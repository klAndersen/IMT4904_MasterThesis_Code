# IMT4904 MasterThesis: Singular feature detector models
 
This directory contains the model for each feature detector. 
This way, one can compare models to see which one has impact (if any) on the classification accuracy. 
Filename describes how many rows was used and which feature this model was based on.

Exceptions are files that has other names, e.g. '*\*\_UP_settings*', these are models created based on the best settings 
from the unprocessed classifier model (but includes all feature detectors).
