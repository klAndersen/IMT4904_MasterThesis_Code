110,19576807.0,-6.0,562.0,"i am wondering how to make an array with values that start at 1111 and go all the way up to 8888. i am asking this because i need to generate a list of 4 digit numbers with each digit ranging from 1-8. i would like to have this in a loop form. also, i am lost on my functions trim, methodicaleliminate, guessandeliminate, and guessthreetheneliminate in my following program. here are the directions: this  has_assignment  focuses on the use of arrays in a program, including using one as a parameter to a function. problem description in the game of mastermind, a player is only given a finite number of guesses to try to identify the hidden combination (such as twelve guesses). often that is the only constraint in playing the game. but some players might make a competition with each other to see who can guess the other's combination in fewer tries. in this case, the problem is not only to come up with a strategy that can find the answer within a specified limit, but to find one that is likely to require the minimal number of guesses. here is where the computer comes in -- one can write a program that would try out different guessing strategies, and see how they work out. since a computer can do the analysis and computations more rapidly than a person, it could just pretend to play mastermind on our behalf using any strategy we choose, and tell us how long it took to do that. overall solution of course, it would be extremely difficult to  has_homework  the computer to reason along the same lines as a person. for example, if we guessed a combination 1111 and got one black peg, we would make a mental note that the answer has exactly one 1 in it, and then proceed to make other guesses with that one fact in mind. if we next guesses 1222 and got one white peg, we would know there were no 2's, and that the single 1 is not in the first position. but how to keep track of such information after a series of guesses would be rather hard. fortunately, for a computer simulation with an array, we can record all of our known facts in a different way. we just maintain a list of all possible answers that there could be, and then remove numbers from the list that could no longer be the solution. if our first guess tells us there is exactly one 1 digit, we would remove all the numbers that do not have that feature. when we find out there are no 2's, we eliminate all the values that contain 2's. eventually, the only number left would be the correct answer. some simple strategies this is a strategy that many players use, resembling what was described above. just methodically got through the possibilities in a straightforward fashion. the first guess of 1111 would answer how many 1's are in the solution; the next guess would answer how many 2's are in the solution, and also say something about where any 1's might be, and so on. with our list approach, which contain a whole lot of possibilities in order beginning with 1111, 1112, 1113, 1114, etc., our next guess would always be the first in the list. the next strategy is for those who like a little more excitement. the guesses appear to be more or less random, with the hopes that a lot more information can be discovered. simulating this approach is surprisingly simple -- if you have a list of numbers, just pick one at random. if you have 837 possibilities to choose from in an array, just pick a random subscript in the range of 0 to 836. this third strategy considers the possibility that answers that give similar results to a given guess are in a sense similar to each other. so to try to get a little more information, it will still pick some numbers at random without regard to how they were evaluated, and then only start thinking about the results. to implement this one, let us just pick any three possible answers and guess them, temporarily ignoring how many black pegs and white pegs they earn us. only after making those guesses will we trim the list of possibilities, then proceeding as the second strategy above. sample interface these are the sample results from the current implementation: please enter a combination to try for, or 0 for a random value: 0 guessing at 2475 guessing 1111... guessing 2222... guessing 2333... guessing 2444... guessing 2455... guessing 2456... guessing 2475... methodical eliminate required 7 tries. guessing 6452... guessing 2416... guessing 2485... guessing 2445... guessing 2435... guessing 2425... guessing 2475... guess and eliminate required 7 tries. guessing 7872... guessing 6472... guessing 1784... guessing 2475... guess three then eliminate required 4 tries. play another game? (y/n) y please enter a combination to try for, or 0 for a random value: 0 guessing at 4474 guessing 1111... guessing 2222... guessing 3333... guessing 4444... guessing 4445... guessing 4464... guessing 4474... methodical eliminate required 7 tries. guessing 3585... guessing 7162... guessing 4474... guess and eliminate required 3 tries. guessing 8587... guessing 1342... guessing 1555... guessing 7464... guessing 6764... guessing 4468... guessing 4474... guess three then eliminate required 7 tries. note: this program allows each digit to go up to 8 instead of 6. even though there are 4096 possible answers, it still finds them rather rapidly. program specifications the assigned program must implement all of the following functions. additional ones are permitted as desired -- these below are required. future  has_ has_assignment   will not detail the functions as below -- but will instead require the students to design their own function descriptions in advance to writing the program. main: simply governs the overall behavior of the program. a number will be chosen as the target combination, and then each strategy will attempt to find it. calls: generateanswer, (to compare all three must have the same answer) methodicaleliminate, guessandeliminate, guessthreetheneliminate generateanswer: either lets the user at the keyboard choose the mystery combination, or gives the option to have the computer generate a random combination. (for a competitive game, it might be interesting to know what sorts of combinations would be the hardest to guess!) parameters: none! returns: a 4-digit combination, each digit in the range 1 to 8 generatesearchspace: populates an array with all possible combinations of four-digit values in the range 1 to 8. parameters: guesses (modified int array) list of guesses length (output int) number of values in list pre-condition: the array must be allocated to no fewer than 4096 elements. trim: analyzes the response to a particular guess and then eliminates any values from the list of possibilities that are no longer possible answers. in each case, it assumes that a value in the list is an answer, and evaluates the guess accordingly. if the number of black and white pegs is not the same as those specified, then it cannot be the correct answer. parameters: guesses (modified int array) list of guesses length (modified int) number of values in list guess (input int) a guess that has been evaluated black (input int) how many black pegs that guess earned white (input int) how many white pegs that guess earned pre-condition: black and white actually do contain the results of comparing the guess with the actual answer post-condition: length has been reduced (we learned something) the viable answers occupy the first 'length' positions in the guesses array (so the list is shorter) calls: evaluate methodicaleliminate: beginning with a list of all possible candidate answers continually guesses the first element in the list, and trim answers accordingly, until an answer is found parameter: answer (input int) the actual answer (necessary to get black/white pegs) returns: number of guesses required to find the answer calls: generatesearchspace, evaluate, trim gusssandeliminate: beginning with a list of all possible candidate answers continually guesses a random element in the list, and trim answers accordingly, until an answer is found parameter: answer (input int) the actual answer returns: number of guesses required to find the answer calls: generatesearchspace, evaluate, trim gusssthreetheneliminate: beginning with a list of all possible candidate answers first guesses three answers at random before trimming the list of possibilites, and then narrows on the answer one random guess at a time parameter: answer (input int) the actual answer returns: number of guesses required to find the answer calls: generatesearchspace, evaluate, trim note: these last functions use the correct answer to evaluate each guess and then use the black/white pegs for the guessing strategy. none of these strategies may peek at the answer to decide what to do next! also: the following functions should also appear in this program from the previous  has_assignment , though they are not themselves part of the grade for this one. evaluate: evaluates a combination by comparing it with the answer correctness is indicated by black pegs (correct digit in correct position) and white pegs (correct digit in incorrect position) parameters: answer (input int) the correct combination guess (input int) the current guess black (output int) number of black pegs white (output int) number of white pegs pre-conditions: answer and guess are both 4-digit numbers with no zero digits post-conditions: black and white are both > 0 and their sum is <= 4 calls: nthdigit, clearnthdigit nthdigit: identified the n'th digit of a combination whether digits count from left to right or right to left is unspecified parameters: combination (input int) combination to examine position (input int) which digit to examine (returned) (output int) the value of the actual digit pre-conditions: combination has the appropriate number of digits, and 0 < position <= number of digits post-condition: 0 <= returned digit <= 9 (single digit) clearnthdigit: ears the n'th digit of a combination to zero, so it will no longer match digits must be counted in the same manner as nthdigit above. parameters: combination (in/out int) combination to modify position (input int) which digit to set to 0 pre-condition: same as those for nthdigit above post-condition: corresponding digit is set to zero calls: nthdigit (optional, depending on the implementation) thank you for reading such this long question, and i hope you can help me on arrays!",generating a list in arrays and use of functions,1.0,3.0,,2917628.0,2013-10-24 21:16:17,<c++><arrays>,,-1.0,12211.0

287,149380.0,94.0,41661.0,"this is an issue that i've spent hours researching in the past. it seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern rdbms solutions but as yet i have not found anything that really addresses what i see to be an incredibly common need in any web or windows application with a database back-end. i speak of dynamic sorting. in my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like: order by @sortcol1, @sortcol2 this is the canonical example given by newbie sql and stored procedure developers all over forums across the internet. ""why isn't this possible?"" they ask. invariably, somebody eventually comes along to  has_homework  them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an order by clause. i know what some of you are already thinking: ""let the client do the sorting, then."" naturally, this offloads the work from your database. in our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months. for this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem. additionally, databases are very good at sorting. they are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner sql writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc. when your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice. then there's the web issue. i've played around with javascript that will do client-side sorting of html tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really really easily, i have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own javascript sorter. the same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over javascript. i'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of datasets, so sue me. but this brings back the point that it isn't possible — or rather, not easily. i've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting. it wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner sql writer would be lost within seconds. already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication."" the following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a t-sql programmer. they are what they are and i fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack. we pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables. for example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default): declare @sortcol1 as varchar(20) declare @sortcol2 as varchar(20) declare @dir1 as varchar(20) declare @dir2 as varchar(20) declare @col1 as varchar(20) declare @col2 as varchar(20) set @col1 = 'storagedatetime'; set @col2 = 'vehicleid'; if @sort = 1 -- default sort. begin set @sortcol1 = @col1; set @dir1 = 'asc'; set @sortcol2 = @col2; set @dir2 = 'asc'; end else if @sort = 2 -- reversed order default sort. begin set @sortcol1 = @col1; set @dir1 = 'desc'; set @sortcol2 = @col2; set @dir2 = 'desc'; end you can already see how if i declared more @colx variables to define other columns i could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause: order by case @dir1 when 'desc' then case @sortcol1 when @col1 then [storagedatetime] when @col2 then [vehicleid] end end desc, case @dir1 when 'asc' then case @sortcol1 when @col1 then [storagedatetime] when @col2 then [vehicleid] end end, case @dir2 when 'desc' then case @sortcol2 when @col1 then [storagedatetime] when @col2 then [vehicleid] end end desc, case @dir2 when 'asc' then case @sortcol2 when @col1 then [storagedatetime] when @col2 then [vehicleid] end end obviously this is a very stripped down example. the real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases. yeah... it gets hairy really quick. the idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there. essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a null value. and thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following: order by null desc, null, [storagedatetime] desc, blah blah you get the idea. it works because sql server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses. this is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of sql can probably see. if i've lost any of you, don't feel bad. it took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it. thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble."" yet it did work. my question is then: is there a better way? i'm okay with solutions other than stored procedure ones, as i realize it may just not be the way to go. preferably, i'd like to know if anyone can do it better within the stored procedure, but if not, how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data (bi-directionally, too) with asp.net? and thank you for reading (or at least skimming) such a long question! ps: be glad i didn't show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting, dynamic filtering/text-searching of columns, pagination via rownumber() over, and try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors... ""behemoth-sized"" doesn't even begin to describe them. update: i would like to avoid dynamic sql. parsing a string together and running an exec on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place. sometimes i wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldn't be worth it, at least in these special dynamic sorting cases. still, i always feel dirty whenever i do dynamic sql strings like that — like i'm still living in the classic asp world. a lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for security. i don't get to make the call on security concerns, only suggest solutions. with sql server 2005 we can set permissions (on a per-user basis if need be) at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly. critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for another question, but again it's not my decision. i'm just the lead code monkey. :)",Dynamic Sorting within SQL Stored Procedures,14.0,2.0,,7290.0,2008-09-29 16:04:19,<sql><tsql><stored-procedures><sorting>,,1.0,8703.0

(we are stuck with unix file permissions.) also, setup on cvs or svn is too hard. darcs is way easy to set up, but it's not obvious how you share things. darcs send (to send patches by email) seems promising but it's not clear how to set it up. the introductory documentation for git is not for beginners. like cvs setup, it's something i myself have trouble with. i'm soliciting suggestions for what source-control to use with beginning students. i suspect we can find resources to put a thin veneer over an existing system and to simplify existing documentation. we probably don't have resources to write new documentation. so, what's really easy to setup, commit, revert, and share changes with a partner but does not have to be easy to merge or to work at scale? a key constraint is that programming pairs have to be able to share work with each other and only each other, and pairs change every week. our infrastructure is linux, solaris, and windows with a netapp filer. i doubt my it staff wants to create a unix group for each pair of students. is there an easier solution i've overlooked?

[new to stackoverflow... please provide comments if i'm doing this wrong.] if you are using svn, versioning of a specific checkout comes along for the ride. build numbering can exploit this to create a unique build number that identifies the specific checkout/revision. [cvs, which we are using for legacy reasons, doesn't provide quite this level of insight... manual intervention with tags gets you part way there.] if you are using maven as your build system, there is support for producing a version number from the scm, as well as a release module for automatically producing releases. [we can't use maven, for a variety of reasons, but this helps those who can. [thanks to marcelo-morales]] if you are using ant as your build system, the following task description can help produce a java .properties file capturing build information, which can then be folded into your build in a number of ways. [we expanded on this idea to include hudson-derived information, thanks marty-lamb]. ant and maven (and hudson and cruise control) provide easy means for getting build numbers into a .properties file, or into a .txt/.html file. is this ""safe"" enough to keep it from being tampered with intentionally or accidentally? is it better to compile it into a ""versioning"" class at build time? assertion: build numbering should be defined/enacted in a continuous integration system like hudson. [thanks to marcelo-morales] we have taken this suggestion, but it does crack open the release engineering question: how does a release happen? are there multiple buildnumbers in a release? is there a meaningful relationship between buildnumbers from differing releases? question: what is the objective behind a build number? is it used for qa? how? is it used primarily by developers to disambiguate between multiple builds during development, or more for qa to determine what build an end-user got? if the goal is reproducibility, in theory this is what a release version number should provide -- why doesn't it? (please answer this as a part of your answers below, it will help illuminate the choices you have made/suggested...) question: is there a place for build numbers in manual builds? is this so problematic that everyone should be using a ci solution? question: should build numbers be checked in to the scm? if the goal is reliably and unambiguously identifying a particular build, how to cope with a variety of continuous or manual build systems that may crash/restart/etc... question: should a build number be short and sweet (i.e., monotonically increasing integer) so that it's easy to stick into file names for archival, easy to refer to in communication, etc... or should it be long and full of usernames, datestamps, machine names, etc? question: please provide details about how the  has_assignment  of build numbers fits into your larger automated release process. yes, maven lovers, we know this is done and done, but not all of us have drunk the kool-aid quite yet... i'd really like to flesh this out into a complete answer, at least for the concrete example of our cvs/ant/hudson setup, so someone could build a complete strategy based on this question. i'll mark as ""the answer"" anyone who can give a soup-to-nuts description for this particular case (including cvs tagging scheme, relevant ci config items, and release procedure that folds the build number into the release such that it's programmatically accessible.) if you want to ask/answer for another particular configuration (say, svn/maven/cruise control) i'll link to the question from here. --ja [edit 23 oct 09] i accepted the top-voted answer because i think it's a reasonable solution, while several of the other answers also include good ideas. if someone wants to take a crack at synthesizing some of these with marty-lamb's, i'll consider accepting a different one. the only concern i have with marty-lamb's is that it doesn't produce a reliably serialized build number -- it depends on a local clock at the builder's system to provide unambiguous build numbers, which isn't great. [edit jul 10] we now include a class like the below. this allows the version numbers to be compiled into the final executable. different forms of the version info are emitted in logging data, long-term archived output products, and used to trace our (sometimes years-later) analysis of output products to a specific build. public final class appversion { // svn should fill this out with the latest tag when it's checked out. private static final string app_svnurl_raw = ""$headurl: svn+ssh://user@host/svnroot/app/trunk/src/appversion.java $""; private static final string app_svn_revision_raw = ""$revision: 325 $""; private static final pattern svnbranch_pat = pattern.compile(""(branches|trunk|releases)\\/([\\w\\.\\-]+)\\/.*""); private static final string app_svntail = app_svnurl_raw.replacefirst("".*\\/svnroot\\/app\\/"", """"); private static final string app_branchtag; private static final string app_branchtag_name; private static final string app_svnrevision = app_svn_revision_raw.replaceall(""\\$revision:\\s*"","""").replaceall(""\\s*\\$"", """"); static { matcher m = svnbranch_pat.matcher(app_svntail); if (!m.matches()) { app_branchtag = ""[broken svn info]""; app_branchtag_name = ""[broken svn info]""; } else { app_branchtag = m.group(1); if (app_branchtag.equals(""trunk"")) { // this isn't necessary in this so example, but it // is since we don't call it trunk in the real case app_branchtag_name = ""trunk""; } else { app_branchtag_name = m.group(2); } } } public static string tagorbranchname() { return app_branchtag_name; } /** answers a formatter string descriptor for the app version. * @return version string */ public static string longstringversion() { return ""app ""+tagorbranchname()+"" (""+ tagorbranchname()+"", svn revision=""+svnrevision()+"")""; } public static string shortstringversion() { return tagorbranchname(); } public static string svnversion() { return app_svnurl_raw; } public static string svnrevision() { return app_svnrevision; } public static string svnbranchid() { return app_branchtag + ""/"" + app_branchtag_name; } public static final string banner() { stringbuilder sb = new stringbuilder(); sb.append(""\n----------------------------------------------------------------""); sb.append(""\napplication -- ""); sb.append(longstringversion()); sb.append(""\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n""); return sb.tostring(); } } leave comments if this deserves to become a wiki discussion.","Build and Version Numbering for Java Projects (ant, cvs, hudson)",9.0,4.0,693169.0,83695.0,2009-03-27 16:18:51,<java><build><build-process><versioning>,,1.0,8882.0

349,810409.0,61.0,19228.0,"i'm going to be teaching a lower-division course in discrete structures. i have selected the text book discrete structures, logic, and computability in part because it contains examples and concepts that are conducive to implementation with a functional programming language. (i also think it's a good  has_homework .) i want an easy-to-understand fp language to illustrate ds concepts and that the students can use. most students will have had only one or two semesters of programming in java, at best. after looking at scheme, erlang, haskell, ocaml, and sml, i've settled on either haskell or standard ml. i'm leaning towards haskell for the reasons outlined below, but i'd like the opinion of those who are active programmers in one or the other. both haskell and sml have pattern matching which makes describing a recursive algorithm a cinch. haskell has nice list comprehensions that match nicely with the way such lists are expressed mathematically. haskell has lazy evaluation. great for constructing infinite lists using the list comprehension technique. sml has a truly interactive interpreter in which functions can be both defined and used. in haskell, functions must be defined in a separate file and compiled before being used in the interactive shell. sml gives explicit confirmation of the function argument and return types in a syntax that's easy to understand. for example: val foo = fn : int * int -> int. haskell's implicit curry syntax is a bit more obtuse, but not totally alien. for example: foo :: int -> int -> int. haskell uses arbitrary-precision integers by default. it's an external library in sml/nj. and sml/nj truncates output to 70 characters by default. haskell's lambda syntax is subtle -- it uses a single backslash. sml is more explicit. not sure if we'll ever need lambda in this class, though. essentially, sml and haskell are roughly equivalent. i lean toward haskell because i'm loving the list comprehensions and infinite lists in haskell. but i'm worried that the extensive number of symbols in haskell's compact syntax might cause students problems. from what i've gathered reading other posts on so, haskell is not recommended for beginners starting out with fp. but we're not going to be building full-fledged applications, just trying out simple algorithms. what do you think? edit: upon reading some of your great responses, i should clarify some of my bullet points. in sml, there's no syntactic distinction between defining a function in the interpreter and defining it in an external file. let's say you want to write the factorial function. in haskell you can put this definition into a file and load it into ghci: fac 0 = 1 fac n = n * fac (n-1) to me, that's clear, succinct, and matches the mathematical definition in the book. but if you want to write the function in ghci directly, you have to use a different syntax: let fac 0 = 1; fac n = n * fac (n-1) when working with interactive interpreters, from a teaching perspective it's very, very handy when the student can use the same code in both a file and the command line. by ""explicit confirmation of the function,"" i meant that upon defining the function, sml right away tells you the name of the function, the types of the arguments, and the return type. in haskell you have to use the :type command and then you get the somewhat confusing curry notation. one more cool thing about haskell--this is a valid function definition: fac 0 = 1 fac (n+1) = (n+1) * fac n again, this matches a definition they might find in the  has_homework . can't do that in sml!",Haskell or Standard ML for beginners?,8.0,7.0,813646.0,17312.0,2009-05-01 06:31:16,<haskell><functional-programming><sml><discrete-mathematics>,,1.0,4056.0

(hint: 'oooooo' makes a funny sound) so when i say speak, the right side is what to speak. and i get that from the inputbox. so when you do several things on a line, like: x = 14 + y; you need to be aware of the order of things. first we add 14 and y. then we put the result (what it evaluates to, or returns) into x. that's my goal, to have a bunch of these cool examples to demonstrate and  has_homework  the class while they have fun. i tried this example on my roommate and while i may not use this as the first lesson, she liked it and learned something. some cool mathematica programs that make beautiful graphs or shapes that are easy to understand would be good ideas and i'm going to look into those. here are some complicated actionscript examples but that's a bit too advanced and i can't  has_homework  flash. what other ideas do you have?",What is the coolest thing you can do in <10 lines of simple code?

edit: some additional information that might be helpful. tables a and b have the same structure as i've done the following to create table b: create table b like a; table a (and thus table b) has a few indexes to help speed up queries that are made against it. again, i'm a relative novice at db work and still learning. i don't know how much of an effect, if any, this has on things. i assume that it does have an effect as the indexes have to be cleaned up too, right? i was also wondering if there were any other db settings that might affect the speed. also, i'm using inno db. here is some additional info that might be helpful to you. table a has a structure similar to this (i've sanitized this a bit): drop table if exists `frobozz`.`a`; create table `frobozz`.`a` ( `id` bigint(20) unsigned not null auto_increment, `fk_g` varchar(30) not null, `h` int(10) unsigned default null, `i` longtext, `j` bigint(20) not null, `k` bigint(20) default null, `l` varchar(45) not null, `m` int(10) unsigned default null, `n` varchar(20) default null, `o` bigint(20) not null, `p` tinyint(1) not null, primary key using btree (`id`), key `idx_l` (`l`), key `idx_h` using btree (`h`), key `idx_m` using btree (`m`), key `idx_fk_g` using btree (`fk_g`), key `fk_g_frobozz` (`id`,`fk_g`), constraint `fk_g_frobozz` foreign key (`fk_g`) references `frotz` (`g`) ) engine=innodb auto_increment=179369 default charset=utf8 row_format=dynamic; i suspect that part of the issue is there are a number of indexes for this table. table b looks similar to table b, though it only contains the columns id and h. also, the profiling results are as follows: starting 0.000018 checking query cache for query 0.000044 checking permissions 0.000005 opening tables 0.000009 init 0.000019 optimizing 0.000004 executing 0.000043 end 0.000005 end 0.000002 query end 0.000003 freeing items 0.000007 logging slow query 0.000002 cleaning up 0.000002 solved thanks to all the responses and comments. they certainly got me to think about the problem. kudos to dotjoe for getting me to step away from the problem by asking the simple question ""do any other tables reference a.id?"" the problem was that there was a delete trigger on table a which called a stored procedure to update two other tables, c and d. table c had a fk back to a.id and after doing some stuff related to that id in the stored procedure, it had the statement, delete from c where c.id = theid; i looked into the explain statement and rewrote this as, explain select * from c where c.other_id = 12345; so, i could see what this was doing and it gave me the following info: id 1 select_type simple table c type all possible_keys null key null key_len null ref null rows 2633 extra using where this told me that it was a painful operation to make and since it was going to get called 22500 times (for the given set of data being deleted), that was the problem. once i created an index on that other_id column and reran the explain, i got: id 1 select_type simple table c type ref possible_keys index_1 key index_1 key_len 8 ref const rows 1 extra much better, in fact really great. i added that index_1 and my delete times are in line with the times reported by mattkemp. this was a really subtle error on my part due to shoe-horning some additional functionality at the last minute. it turned out that most of the suggested alternative delete/select statements, as daniel stated, ended up taking essentially the same amount of time and as soulmerge mentioned, the statement was pretty much the best i was going to be able to construct based on what i needed to do. once i provided an index for this other table c, my deletes were fast. postmortem: two lessons learned came out of this  has_homework . first, it is clear that i didn't leverage the power of the explain statement to get a better idea of the impact of my sql queries. that's a rookie mistake, so i'm not going to beat myself up about that one. i'll learn from that mistake. second, the offending code was the result of a 'get it done quick' mentality and inadequate design/testing led to this problem not showing up sooner. had i generated several sizable test data sets to use as test input for this new functionality, i'd have not wasted my time nor yours. my testing on the db side was lacking the depth that my application side has in place. now i've got the opportunity to improve that. reference: explain statement",Faster way to delete matching rows?,13.0,6.0,830599.0,7862.0,2009-05-01 18:12:09,<mysql><performance><sql-delete><explain-plan>,,1.0,6505.0
