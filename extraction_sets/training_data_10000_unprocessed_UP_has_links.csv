5,3036150.0,-6.0,1804.0,"i am sharing a tip with you all.please add on to this discussion. jquery helps faster page load than javascript. jquery functions are fired when the related elements are loaded, instead of complete pageload. this is a common practice to call a javascript function when page is loaded like window.onload = function(){ alert(""mindfire"") } or inside of which is the code that we want to run right when the page is loaded. problematically, however, the javascript code isn't run until all images are finished downloading (this includes banner ads). the reason for using window.onload in the first place is due to the fact that the html 'document' isn't finished loading yet, when you first try to run your code. to circumvent both problems, jquery has a simple statement that checks the document and waits until it's ready to be manipulated, known as the ready event $(document).ready(function() { // your code here });",How to run Javascript code before document is completely loaded (using jQuery),2.0,2.0,,364475.0,2010-06-14 09:28:21,<javascript><jquery>,2010-06-14 10:08:06,-1.0,1341.0

86,8997978.0,-7.0,901.0,"i'm building a picture loader which has two major abilities: 1) loading pictures in a thread, and 2) saving cached images. since i implemented nativejpg 1.32, i have been noticing that a tsdjpggraphic uses approximately 3 times as much memory as the tjpegimage. i'm not concerned about resolving how much it reserves, but rather to make sure my threads manage the memory properly. specifications tpictureloader is the main component for this system. every time a picture needs to be loaded, a thread is spawned to acquire that image. when the image is available, an event is triggered providing this image in the form of a tbitmap. component has a queue, and a limitation of how many threads can be active at once (via activethreads property). every picture requested immediately creates a thread - but the thread is not executed until necessary. activethreads determines how many of these threads can run at a time (otherwise, how many pictures can be loaded at a time). problem tjpegimage always loads the pictures fine with no errors. but, using a global conditional, i enable the use of nativejpg (tsdjpggraphic) and i have memory problems. the error message is not enough storage is available to process this command. this error is raised only internally (in debug), and actually does not show any error when the app is running stand-alone. it doesn't go to any breakpoint in my code, but rather in the nativejpg unit on line 460: fbitmap := setbitmapfromiterator(aiterator); using the standard tjpegimage, i never have problems with memory. whether i load the picture once and then clear it from the memory, or load the picture once and save it somewhere in the memory, either way doesn't seem to make a difference. the strange thing is that my memory just about maxes out using tjpegimage yet never raises any error, but when using a tsdjpggraphic, the memory barely nudges at all and it already starts spitting out these errors. when analyzing the memory usage, i'm seeing this... question how do i avoid this error in any situation? this system will be used in many environments, many of which will be very sluggish computers. especially since i'm working with multithreading here, memory usage is critical. source code unit pictureloader;

(in this case, i want to search an associative array within the class before giving up.) however, perl is... quite a bit different from php, given that classes are already hashes. is there any way that i can apply some equivalent of __get() and __set() to a perl ""class"" that will remain completely encapsulated in that package, transparent to anything trying to actually get or set properties? edit: the best way to explain this may be to show you code, show the output, and then show what i want it to output. package accesstest; my $test = new sammich; #""improper"" style, don't care, not part of the question. say 'bacon is: ' . $test->{'bacon'}; say 'cheese is: ' . $test->{'cheese'}; for (keys $test->{'moreproperties'}) { say ""$_ => "" . $test->{'moreproperties'}{$_}; } say 'invalid is: ' . $test->{'invalid'}; say 'setting invalid.'; $test->{'invalid'} = 'true'; say 'invalid is now: ' . $test->{'invalid'}; for (keys $test->{'moreproperties'}) { say ""$_ => "" . $test->{'moreproperties'}{$_}; } package sammich; sub new { my $classname = shift; my $this = { 'bacon' => 'yes', 'moreproperties' => { 'cheese' => 'maybe', 'ham' => 'no' } }; return bless($this, $classname); } this currently outputs: bacon is: yes use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at ./accesstest.pl line 11. cheese is: cheese => maybe ham => no use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at ./accesstest.pl line 17. invalid is: setting invalid. invalid is now: true cheese => maybe ham => no now, i need to make modifications to sammich only, without making any changes at all to the initial accesstest package, that will result in this: bacon is: yes cheese is: maybe cheese => maybe ham => no invalid is: 0 setting invalid. invalid is now: true cheese => maybe ham => no invalid => true as you can see, the desired effect is that the 'cheese' property, since it's not a part of the test object directly, would instead be grabbed from the 'moreproperties' hash. 'invalid' would attempt the same thing, but since it is neither a direct property nor in 'moreproperties', it would act in whatever way programmed - in this case, i would want it to simply return the value 0, without any errors or warnings. upon attempting to set the 'invalid' property, it would not be added to the object directly, because it's not already there, but would instead be added to the 'moreproperties' hash. i'm expecting this to take more than the six or so lines it would require in php, but as it is a very important concept of oop, i fully expect perl to handle it somehow.",Perl - Overloading package/class properties?,4.0,7.0,,1145938.0,2012-06-08 13:12:54,<perl><oop><overloading><getter-setter>,,-1.0,3571.0

491,19312677.0,-9.0,4086.0,"edit: an improvement to this algorithm been found. your are welcome to see it. this question is the an improvement of my old question. now i want to show you java code sample, and explain my algorithm in more details. i think that i found a polynomial algorithm to get an exact solution to the traveling salesman problem. my implementation is build from 5 steps: 1) quick setup 2) search for solution 3) stop condition 1 4) stop condition 2 5) stop condition 3 i want to start from step 2 and 3, and if i do not get wrong there i will show you the rest of it. so what i am going to show you now, is not polynomial algorithm, but an improvement to held–karp algorithm that solves the problem in time o(n^2 2^n) lets say we want to solve a 6 cities route with the brout algorithm. there are (6-1)! = 120 options for that, we will need to test them all and return the shortest route founded. so it will look something like that(cities names are: a, b, c, d, e, f): option 1 : a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> a option 2 : a -> b -> c -> d -> f -> e -> a option 3 : a -> c -> b -> d -> e -> f -> a option 4 : a -> c -> b -> d -> f -> e -> a . . option 120 now i am saying that after calculating option 1 and 2, you can skip over options 3 and 4. how do you do that? it's simple: when calculating option 1 you need to calculate what will be the shortest route starting from city d, finishing in city a, and going thru cities e, f, it actually calculating options 1 and 2. what we want to do is to build a map of 4 cities where we force what would be the first and the last city, in this example when calculating option 1 you create a map of d,e,f,a that holds the data of what would be the shortest path from d to a thru e,f. so now when you start calculating options 3 and 4 you can stop when reaching city d, because you already know what would be the shortest route starting at city d, finishing in city a and going thru cities e, f. this is the principle that i used in my algorithm. i run a brute algorithm and mapped all the sub results, those results are not sub routes, do not confuse there. they are just part of calculation that need to be done in order to find the shortest route. so each time i recognize i am doing the same calculation i used a solution from a map. here is an output of my algorithm running over 19 cities. this is just one sample but it have a bigger meaning than that. in fact it represent all the results for 19 cities. no matter what 19 cities input will it be, the algorithm will always create the same amount of maps, perform the same amount of actions and will resolve with the same time. source(19) [10.0,65.0, 34.0,52.0, 37.0,98.0, 39.0,44.0, 43.0,37.0, 45.0,89.0, 66.0,79.0, 69.0,74.0, 7.0,76.0, 70.0,15.0, 77.0,27.0, 78.0,11.0, 78.0,13.0, 80.0,5.0, 81.0,38.0, 82.0,64.0, 87.0,7.0, 90.0,61.0, 93.0,31.0] finish mapengine test after 321550 mills created: 20801457 map(3) write 2448 read 34272 map(4) write 12240 read 159120 map(5) write 42840 read 514080 map(6) write 111384 read 1225224 map(7) write 222768 read 2227680 map(8) write 350064 read 3150576 map(9) write 437580 read 3500640 map(10) write 437580 read 3084270 map(11) write 352185 read 2344256 map(12) write 245131 read 1382525 map(13) write 135638 read 570522 map(14) write 54320 read 156758 map(15) write 15077 read 27058 map(16) write 2809 read 2087 map(17) write 306 read 0 map(18) write 18 read 0 map(19) write 1 read 0 0) 295.5947584525372> [10.0,65.0, 34.0,52.0, 39.0,44.0, 43.0,37.0, 70.0,15.0, 78.0,13.0, 78.0,11.0, 80.0,5.0, 87.0,7.0, 77.0,27.0, 93.0,31.0, 81.0,38.0, 90.0,61.0, 82.0,64.0, 69.0,74.0, 66.0,79.0, 45.0,89.0, 37.0,98.0, 7.0,76.0, 10.0,65.0] source(19) is the input cities. it took my pc 321550 mills to calculate, (about 5 minutes). created: 20801457 represent the number of search instances created(all the times that i used map or created the map. you will need to see the code to understand this number better). map(3) speaks about the number of maps with 3 cities that been created. it created 2448 3 cities maps and used them 34272 times. the number of maps that my algorithm will produce with k cities size in n cities route will be: the number of times i can select the first city of my map: n multiplies the number of times i can choose different selection of my cities from the remaining cities: (n-1)! / ((n - k - 1)! * (k-1)!). thas come to n! / ((n - k - 1)! * (k-1)!). assuming that creating a map of size 3 is an atomic action, then my algorithm efficiency will be the sum of all those maps. so my algorithm have the next efficiency. n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2! + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * (n - 3) / 3! + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * (n - 3) (n -4) / 4! + ... n! / (n - 1)! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2! + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * (n - 3) / 3! + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * (n - 3) (n -4) / 4! + ... n so what kind of efficiency is this? it looks like exponential function of o(n^c*2^n) where c is just a bit smaller than one. i found this by solving the efficiency algorithm, with n from 7 to 100, and compare it to the previous results(result of n = 9 with n =8, result of n = 24 with n = 23) and i find out that for big numbers of n the comparison result is 2. then i did the same with the traditional dynamic programing algorithm efficiency. here is the list of what i got: column 1 is n, column 2 is my algorithm efficiency compare, column 3 is dynamic programming algorithm compare and column 4 is my algorithm efficiency multiply n compare. 7 2.55769 2.72222 2.98397 8 2.40601 2.61224 2.74973 9 2.31562 2.53125 2.60507 10 2.2582 2.46913 2.50912 11 2.21972 2.42 2.44169 12 2.19258 2.38016 2.39191 13 2.17251 2.34722 2.35356 14 2.15701 2.31952 2.32293 15 2.14456 2.29591 2.29774 16 2.13424 2.27555 2.27652 17 2.12548 2.25781 2.25832 18 2.1179 2.24221 2.24248 19 2.11124 2.22839 2.22853 20 2.10533 2.21606 2.21614 21 2.10003 2.205 2.20503 22 2.09525 2.19501 2.19503 23 2.09091 2.18595 2.18596 24 2.08696 2.17769 2.17769 25 2.08333 2.17013 2.17014 26 2.08 2.1632 2.1632 27 2.07692 2.1568 2.1568 28 2.07407 2.15089 2.15089 29 2.07142 2.1454 2.1454 30 2.06896 2.1403 2.1403 31 2.06666 2.13555 2.13555 32 2.06451 2.13111 2.13111 33 2.0625 2.12695 2.12695 34 2.0606 2.12304 2.12304 35 2.05882 2.11937 2.11937 36 2.05714 2.11591 2.11591 37 2.05555 2.11265 2.11265 38 2.05405 2.10956 2.10956 39 2.05263 2.10664 2.10664 40 2.05128 2.10387 2.10387 41 2.05 2.10125 2.10125 42 2.04878 2.09875 2.09875 43 2.04761 2.09637 2.09637 44 2.04651 2.0941 2.0941 45 2.04545 2.09194 2.09194 46 2.04444 2.08987 2.08987 47 2.04347 2.0879 2.0879 48 2.04255 2.08601 2.08601 49 2.04166 2.0842 2.0842 50 2.04081 2.08246 2.08246 51 2.04 2.0808 2.0808 52 2.03921 2.0792 2.0792 53 2.03846 2.07766 2.07766 54 2.03773 2.07618 2.07618 55 2.03703 2.07475 2.07475 56 2.03636 2.07338 2.07338 57 2.03571 2.07206 2.07206 58 2.03508 2.07079 2.07079 59 2.03448 2.06956 2.06956 60 2.03389 2.06837 2.06837 61 2.03333 2.06722 2.06722 62 2.03278 2.06611 2.06611 63 2.03225 2.06503 2.06503 64 2.03174 2.06399 2.06399 65 2.03125 2.06298 2.06298 66 2.03076 2.06201 2.06201 67 2.0303 2.06106 2.06106 68 2.02985 2.06014 2.06014 69 2.02941 2.05925 2.05925 70 2.02898 2.05839 2.05839 71 2.02857 2.05755 2.05755 72 2.02816 2.05673 2.05673 73 2.02777 2.05594 2.05594 74 2.02739 2.05516 2.05516 75 2.02702 2.05441 2.05441 76 2.02666 2.05368 2.05368 77 2.02631 2.05297 2.05297 78 2.02597 2.05228 2.05228 79 2.02564 2.05161 2.05161 80 2.02531 2.05095 2.05095 81 2.025 2.05031 2.05031 82 2.02469 2.04968 2.04968 83 2.02439 2.04907 2.04907 84 2.02409 2.04848 2.04848 85 2.0238 2.0479 2.0479 86 2.02352 2.04733 2.04733 87 2.02325 2.04678 2.04678 88 2.02298 2.04624 2.04624 89 2.02272 2.04571 2.04571 90 2.02247 2.04519 2.04519 91 2.02222 2.04469 2.04469 92 2.02197 2.04419 2.04419 93 2.02173 2.04371 2.04371 94 2.0215 2.04324 2.04324 95 2.02127 2.04277 2.04277 96 2.02105 2.04232 2.04232 97 2.02083 2.04188 2.04188 98 2.02061 2.04144 2.04144 99 2.0204 2.04102 2.04102 100 2.0202 2.0406 2.0406 see how column 3 and 4 are almost the same. this is how i found it. please verify my work, take a look at the code, tell me if you agree or not with me. if not please show me where my algorithm or my math is not working by exact sample. if you agree with me, then help me to change the wiki page by showing that this part of my algorithm is better then held–karp algorithm.",Java: Traveling Salesman - Found polynomial algorithm,3.0,7.0,19469990.0,1129332.0,2013-10-11 07:33:56,<java><graph><traveling-salesman><np-complete><np-hard>,,-1.0,11374.0

563,22624307.0,-6.0,238.0,"in the beginning, there was c. and c had structure, and expressions, and functions to package them. and it was good. but c also had goto and switch case falling and syntax that followed use, so maybe not that good. it also had pointers, causing much gnashing of teeth from aliasing and pointer arithmetic! but it also had function pointers, allowing run time dispatch, and much rejoicing followed. now, data could dictate code, as well as code dictating data, and both were first class (or close). for anything that could be pointed to, could be pointed to, with the same pointer: the holy void*. and all were equal in it's glory. then c++ came, and bound the data and the code into the object. and lo, this was just syntactical sugar, for a function and a method are not so different, (no matter what the sun or the oracle may tell you). obj->foo(int val) being (approximately) the same as foo(obj* this, int val), they were still equal, under the holy void*. and then, with inheritance, came strife, as the outer derived class may add to the inner base. but lo, in these simple times, a solution was found: put every base before derived. then, with the same pointer, we may point to both child and father. and still, anything that could be pointed to, could be pointed to with the holy void*. with the virtual, we lost our simplicity, and wandered for ages. wondering, how to deal with diamonds, or circles which are not quite ellipses. but even as we cast off our old tenants of c, with each instruction reducing to simple asm, we embraced, that some things should look simple (even if, under, they are complex). and so, we looked at the secret vtables that arose and thought ""good enough"". for while we had introduced hidden data, we had reduced complexity. and now, any call made through a virtual was redirected through a vtable. and as all subobjects of a class could be pointed to through a single pointer, this was enough. but even though the dispatch method had changed, we could still point to all things, with holy void*. but then was made, what many in the present time, consider a grave mistake: multiple inheritance. and no longer would one pointer suffice! for how can both base fathers be at the start? and no longer, then, would a vtable suffice, for how would we know which subobject to point to! and now, the problem of diamonds arises even worse than before, with no obvious solution, and our prior ones requiring current code to deal with future prospects! and so, pointer adjustments must be made, with each virtual call. because a base class may really be a mi derived class in disguise, and needs to be adjusted. so for the support of the choice few who used mi, we all paid a price. and suddenly, the holy void* could no longer store what had hither-forth been simple sugar. and what arose to deal with this complexity, was the dreaded member function pointer. the beast required it's own syntax, for none others would suffice. and this syntax, as rarely used, would be so low in precedence as to require parans with every use. though in the holy standard, what wicked council decided to allow such wretched things to be cast, but when cast from type to type, not called without invoking behavior most undefined! and nay, decadent with syntax and greedy, they were fat and could not fit into void*. as the only way to know what object to point to, was with an adjustment, nestled deep in the pointer, and checked with each vtable lookup. but this, brothers, is not how it must be. this complexity of implementation comes from a most peculiar of decisions. class base1 { public: virtual void foo(); }; class base2 { public: virtual void bar(); }; class derived: public base1, public base2 { public: void unrelated(); } as is seen here, derived* must be adjusted when calling foo() or bar(); it cannot point to base1 and base2 at the same time, as in the case of simple single inheritance. it is, indeed, impossible to properly predict how much of an offset is needed, when called from a base class, which is why most have some sort of mechanism for adding it into the vtable. however: class derived: public base1, public base2 { public: void unrelated(); virtual void foo() { base1::foo(); } virtual void bar() { base2::bar(); } } solves the problem, with nary a change to the original object model! as each method now exists, it can be added properly to the vtable, and when called, knows exactly how much to adjust the pointer, allowing the call to proceed without any mucking about! and now, both casting a member function pointer as well as calling it when cast, are well defined! and most importantly of all, anything that can be pointed to, can be pointed to by a holy void*. all a member function pointer need be is a normal function pointer that takes a special first parameter. and lo, things would have been pretty good. if only we lived in such a dream world. unfortunately for us, we live with fat member function pointers, vtables that have to adjust each and every call, and member function pointers that cannot appropriately create delegates or many other useful patterns. in msvc, they change size when you cast them! the problem is so great that std::function can allocate memory dynamically in most implementations, because of the various problems outlined here. the use of thunks for unoverriden methods, as i have detailed, would solve this problem quite handily, and the cost of this is a few inlinable hidden methods, and some vtable changes, along with a possible (but tiny) decrease in the speed of a virtual dispatch, in the case the function isn't overriden and also can't be inlined perfectly. and for this tiny negligible increase in speed and space, we've created a monstrosity in member function pointers, and influenced a half dozen other languages not to use multiple inheritance despite the easily solved problems, castrated member function pointers in use, and made our delegates slower. in fact, as noted in the fastest possible delegates, the current solution actually slows down every virtual invocation; it forces extra checking, and extra memory usage, via fat pointers, which even for single inheritance, must store extra data (or risk losing it, as msvc member function pointers can). this is clearly not in the ""pay if you use, not if you don't"" philosophy of c++! so, to reiterate, why are member function pointers different from ""loose"" function pointers? is there any logical reason why they are not simply function pointers with a special calling convention, or with an extra argument for the ""this""?",Why are member function pointers different from normal function pointers in C++?,1.0,6.0,,3137484.0,2014-03-25 02:20:53,<c++><oop><multiple-inheritance><language-lawyer><member-function-pointers>,2014-03-25 02:55:30,-1.0,7578.0

(first one shows messages from both sides, second one is used to type in a new message) the following command clears the edit box. (see setfocus below) i don't want that. this behaviour changed from windows xp to windows 7 or between delphi versions not sure which. last time i looked at this i think it may have been a changed in windows versions, delphi's edit box may have been implemented with windows apis. it didn't use to do that on windows xp and/or previous versions of delphi. the problem is with: vactivecontrol.setfocus; this clears the edit box... i don't want that. this is a problem when the user is entering a new message and a message arrives from the other side... the code switches focus back and forth between rich edit messages and edit box.. which causes the newly typed message to be cleared, which is ofcourse annoying. (one possible solution which comes to mind is remembering what was typed and re-pasting it after this flip flop happens) focus must be set back to this edit box after the rich edit chatter messages were updated. so that the user can continue typing in new messages. is there an easy fix ? (perhaps the remember trick and repasting might work, perhaps there are other solutions) it would also be nice if the rich edit chatter messages would auto scroll down without requiring focus... now focus flip flops between chatter messages, and chatter edit box to type new message. if user wanted to enter messages real fast... it might end up in the rich edit box cause the set focus back to chat edit box didnt happen fast enough.. i may try and replace vcl with firemonkey... i am not sure if firemonkey has better support for writing network chat apps and focussing and text scrolling and such. i may investigate that also. copy & paste for text is also nice. (it would be preferred if fixes work across windows versions, perhaps the remember and repaste trick might work, i am aware that firemonkey may not work on all windows versions, i am considering to make a dual version, one vcl and one firemonkey version.) procedure tformmain.chattermessagereceived( sender : tobject ); var vactivecontrol : twincontrol; begin vactivecontrol := screen.activecontrol; // richeditchattermessages.lines.add( protocolwrapper.chatter.othernickname + ': ' + protocolwrapper.chatter.othermessage ); richeditchattermessages.lines.add( 'remote: ' + protocolwrapper.chatter.othermessage ); // richeditchattermessages.perform(em_linescroll, 0, richeditchattermessages.lines.count); // werkt niet goed if coloredpagecontrol1.activepage = coloredtabsheetchatter then begin richeditchattermessages.setfocus; // must set focus first for perform scroll caret to work end; richeditchattermessages.perform (em_scrollcaret,0,0); if vactivecontrol <> nil then begin vactivecontrol.setfocus; end; coloredtabsheetchatter.tabcolor := cllime; flashapplication; end; the internet has been updated since i discovered this problem. i came across this solution which seems to work so far... will have to test on different windows versions and situations and such... looks promising, deleting this question for now, cause it might be a duplicate already: procedure scrolltoend(arichedit: trichedit); var isselectionhidden: boolean; begin with arichedit do begin selstart := perform(messages.em_lineindex, lines.count, 0);//set caret at end isselectionhidden := hideselection; try hideselection := false; perform(messages.em_scrollcaret, 0, 0); // scroll to caret finally hideselection := isselectionhidden; end; end; end; procedure tformmain.chattermessagereceived( sender : tobject ); begin // richeditchattermessages.lines.add( protocolwrapper.chatter.othernickname + ': ' + protocolwrapper.chatter.othermessage ); richeditchattermessages.lines.add( 'remote: ' + protocolwrapper.chatter.othermessage ); scrolltoend(richeditchattermessages); coloredtabsheetchatter.tabcolor := cllime; flashapplication; end; i am undeleting this question though. this solution has other drawbacks though. user might not be able to select text anymore if other user is chatting. also it seems to raise exceptions. (not sure why, maybe it happens when user tries to select text, or maybe the cause of the exception was from something else... investigating...) this is one nasty problem... i think the solution is to use a solution that works for whatever version of richedit dll delphi is using. this creates a bit of a tricky situation... if one wants to write code that works in all delphi versions... for now just using this seems to work in delphi xe6: perform(messages.em_scrollcaret, 0, 0); // scroll to caret i may have to use {$ifdef } here and there if i want this code to work for all delphi versions... so i may again have to investigate this problem in the future. here is a nice link to microsoft document about this control: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb787873(v=vs.85).aspx there are 4 versions: •versions of rich edit ◦rich edit version 1.0 ◦rich edit version 2.0 ◦rich edit version 3.0 ◦rich edit version 4.1 i am not sure which delphi versions use which control version. and which version of the control has the scroll issue... to be continued... (for now i ll focus on delphi xe6 and perhaps in the future return to this issue if i want my software to work on different windows versions and delphi versions) this could be a cool solution: how to test if a control is a richedit control ^ detecting at runtime which version of the control is being used by any delphi version. then coding a solution per control version, that would be nice. further hints: comctrls unit has this code which determines which version is being loaded: richeditmodulename = 'riched20.dll'; maybe it's possible to replace rich edit with simply a tmemo... or maybe not... maybe tmemo doesn't scroll or maybe it's the same kind of control... or didn't look good... not sure why rich edit was preferred. i think i was worried tmemo can only contain a limited ammount of lines ? this perform solution is also not very good. if the user switches focus to other controls... it will interfere with the carrot of those controls. woops forgot to include richeditcontrol.. instead of: perform(messages.em_scrollcaret, 0, 0); // scroll to caret this code works better: richeditchattermessages.perform(messages.em_scrollcaret, 0, 0); // scroll to caret performance monitoring control was refreshing itself so was also not a good way to test this effect... so far so good. perhaps switching to a better gui like firemonkey might be a solution. though perhaps firemonkey would introduce new problems, seeing all these problems with vcl/richedit... it's worth a try. though firemonkey... not sure which windows versions that would work on... for now still interesting to investigate vcl/richedit and so forth for old os-es and such. also what has not yet been discussed is why tedit is clear when it receives .setfocus... hmm... the problem was found by one of the commentors below. tedit.autoselect property when set to true creates this clearing behaviour... see test code below provided by ""despatcher"". one remaining problem that remains is... the richedit does not scroll if it's not visible/in focus or something... so for example another tab is visible. i tried using .setfocus on the richedit but doesn't seem to help... actually there was a branch in front of it... it will only set focus if tab was selected by user... therefore setfocus was not being applied... hmm... ofcourse i can't interrupt the user with a setfocus like that anyway... hmmm... so setfocus is probably out of the question... must find a different way to scroll the richedit downwards so its nicely position on most recent messages or so... hmmm... ok finally all problems solved: sendmessage(richeditchattermessages.handle, wm_vscroll, sb_bottom, 0); works perfectly for scrolling down... as long as all event handlers use this method for the rich edit.",SetFocus clears edit box.

(a, field(a)) is supposed to create an instance of jsobject. so, i opened the play doc, jsobject. hmm..., i guess it's this constructor (?): jsobject(fields: seq[(string, jsvalue)]) .... but,... i really doubt it.... i'm lost here. anyway, let's see an example how it is used: val customwrites: writes[person] = json.writes[person]. addfield(""isadult"", _.isadult) so..., _.isadult is supposed to map to a block with the following signature: a => t ... but..., if that's really the case, i was expecting {x => x.isadult} .... so i guess _.isadult is a syntactic-sugar provided by scala (?). so... back to the definition of addfield: field(a) executes the block ""_.isadult"". i can infer here that a is an instance of person then. can you help me decipher all this? scala is cool, but it's doc system (still) sucks :(",Deciphering Scala code...

(ok, that last one isn't really what unit testing should be used for, but it doesn't hurt.) load a copy of the production database and test against that. the problem here is that you may have no idea what's in the production db at any given time; your tests may need to be rewritten if data changes over time. some people have pointed out that both of these strategies rely on specific data, and a unit test should test only functionality. to that end, i've seen suggested: use a mock database server, and check only that the orm is sending the correct queries in response to a given method call. what strategies have you used for testing database-driven applications, if any? what has worked the best for you?",What's the best strategy for unit-testing database-driven applications?,6.0,0.0,145163.0,20745.0,2008-09-28 03:26:42,<database><unit-testing><orm><mocking>,,1.0,1945.0

1169,149380.0,94.0,41661.0,"this is an issue that i've spent hours researching in the past. it seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern rdbms solutions but as yet i have not found anything that really addresses what i see to be an incredibly common need in any web or windows application with a database back-end. i speak of dynamic sorting. in my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like: order by @sortcol1, @sortcol2 this is the canonical example given by newbie sql and stored procedure developers all over forums across the internet. ""why isn't this possible?"" they ask. invariably, somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an order by clause. i know what some of you are already thinking: ""let the client do the sorting, then."" naturally, this offloads the work from your database. in our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months. for this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem. additionally, databases are very good at sorting. they are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner sql writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc. when your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice. then there's the web issue. i've played around with javascript that will do client-side sorting of html tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really really easily, i have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own javascript sorter. the same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over javascript. i'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of datasets, so sue me. but this brings back the point that it isn't possible — or rather, not easily. i've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting. it wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner sql writer would be lost within seconds. already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication."" the following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a t-sql programmer. they are what they are and i fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack. we pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables. for example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default): declare @sortcol1 as varchar(20) declare @sortcol2 as varchar(20) declare @dir1 as varchar(20) declare @dir2 as varchar(20) declare @col1 as varchar(20) declare @col2 as varchar(20) set @col1 = 'storagedatetime'; set @col2 = 'vehicleid'; if @sort = 1 -- default sort. begin set @sortcol1 = @col1; set @dir1 = 'asc'; set @sortcol2 = @col2; set @dir2 = 'asc'; end else if @sort = 2 -- reversed order default sort. begin set @sortcol1 = @col1; set @dir1 = 'desc'; set @sortcol2 = @col2; set @dir2 = 'desc'; end you can already see how if i declared more @colx variables to define other columns i could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause: order by case @dir1 when 'desc' then case @sortcol1 when @col1 then [storagedatetime] when @col2 then [vehicleid] end end desc, case @dir1 when 'asc' then case @sortcol1 when @col1 then [storagedatetime] when @col2 then [vehicleid] end end, case @dir2 when 'desc' then case @sortcol2 when @col1 then [storagedatetime] when @col2 then [vehicleid] end end desc, case @dir2 when 'asc' then case @sortcol2 when @col1 then [storagedatetime] when @col2 then [vehicleid] end end obviously this is a very stripped down example. the real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases. yeah... it gets hairy really quick. the idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there. essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a null value. and thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following: order by null desc, null, [storagedatetime] desc, blah blah you get the idea. it works because sql server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses. this is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of sql can probably see. if i've lost any of you, don't feel bad. it took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it. thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble."" yet it did work. my question is then: is there a better way? i'm okay with solutions other than stored procedure ones, as i realize it may just not be the way to go. preferably, i'd like to know if anyone can do it better within the stored procedure, but if not, how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data (bi-directionally, too) with asp.net? and thank you for reading (or at least skimming) such a long question! ps: be glad i didn't show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting, dynamic filtering/text-searching of columns, pagination via rownumber() over, and try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors... ""behemoth-sized"" doesn't even begin to describe them. update: i would like to avoid dynamic sql. parsing a string together and running an exec on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place. sometimes i wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldn't be worth it, at least in these special dynamic sorting cases. still, i always feel dirty whenever i do dynamic sql strings like that — like i'm still living in the classic asp world. a lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for security. i don't get to make the call on security concerns, only suggest solutions. with sql server 2005 we can set permissions (on a per-user basis if need be) at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly. critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for another question, but again it's not my decision. i'm just the lead code monkey. :)",Dynamic Sorting within SQL Stored Procedures,14.0,2.0,,7290.0,2008-09-29 16:04:19,<sql><tsql><stored-procedures><sorting>,,1.0,8703.0

(or do you think my argument about raii's obvious advantages are flawed?) edit: i must have not phrased the question clearly since the first four answers have missed the point. i know about finalize and its non-deterministic characteristics, i know about the using construct and i feel these two options are inferior to raii. using is one more thing the consumer of a class must remember (how many people forgot to put a streamreader in a using block?). my question is a philosophical one about the language design, why is it the way it is and can it be improved? for instance with a generic deterministically destructible value-type i can make the using and lock keywords redundant (achievable by library classes): public struct disposer where t : idisposable { t val; public disposer(t t) { val = t; } public t value { get { return val; } } ~disposer() // currently illegal { if (val != default(t)) val.dispose(); } } i can't help but end with a apropos quotation which i once saw but can't currently find its origin. you can take my deterministic destruction when my cold dead hand goes out of scope. --anon",Why is there no RAII in .NET?,7.0,0.0,173845.0,3848.0,2008-10-06 09:25:16,<.net><struct><destructor><raii><value-type>,,1.0,3124.0

(updating numerous select, insert and update queries vs. updating the mapping config and possibly refactoring the business classes and dtos.) also, using nhibernate you can run into unforeseen problems if you do not know the framework very well. that could be, for example, trusting the table.hbm.xml where you set a string’s length to be automatically validated. however, i can also imagine similar bugs in a “simple” sqlconnection query based data access layer. finally, are those arguments mentioned above really a good reason not to utilise an orm for a non-trivial database based enterprise application? are there probably other arguments they/i might have missed? (i should probably add that i think this is like the first “big” .net/c# based application which will require teamwork. good practices, which are seen as pretty normal on stack overflow, such as unit testing or continuous integration, are non-existing here up to now.)",Are there good reasons not to use an ORM?,20.0,0.0,194160.0,11963.0,2008-10-11 14:43:03,<c#><nhibernate><orm><enterprise>,2012-10-31 03:27:59,1.0,2301.0

1369,245742.0,80.0,87680.0,"in this thread, we look at examples of good uses of goto in c or c++. it's inspired by an answer which people voted up because they thought i was joking. summary (label changed from original to make intent even clearer): infinite_loop: // code goes here goto infinite_loop; why it's better than the alternatives: it's specific. goto is the language construct which causes an unconditional branch. alternatives depend on using structures supporting conditional branches, with a degenerate always-true condition. the label documents the intent without extra comments. the reader doesn't have to scan the intervening code for early breaks (although it's still possible for an unprincipled hacker to simulate continue with an early goto). rules: pretend that the gotophobes didn't win. it's understood that the above can't be used in real code because it goes against established idiom. assume that we have all heard of 'goto considered harmful' and know that goto can be used to write spaghetti code. if you disagree with an example, criticize it on technical merit alone ('because people don't like goto' is not a technical reason). let's see if we can talk about this like grown ups. edit this question seems finished now. it generated some high quality answers. thanks to everyone, especially those who took my little loop example seriously. most skeptics were concerned by the lack of block scope. as @quinmars pointed out in a comment, you can always put braces around the loop body. i note in passing that for(;;) and while(true) don't give you the braces for free either (and omitting them can cause vexing bugs). anyway, i won't waste any more of your brain power on this trifle - i can live with the harmless and idiomatic for(;;) and while(true) (just as well if i want to keep my job). considering the other responses, i see that many people view goto as something you always have to rewrite in another way. of course you can avoid a goto by introducing a loop, an extra flag, a stack of nested ifs, or whatever, but why not consider whether goto is perhaps the best tool for the job? put another way, how much ugliness are people prepared to endure to avoid using a built-in language feature for its intended purpose? my take is that even adding a flag is too high a price to pay. i like my variables to represent things in the problem or solution domains. 'solely to avoid a goto' doesn't cut it. i'll accept the first answer which gave the c pattern for branching to a cleanup block. imo, this makes the strongest case for a goto of all the posted answers, certainly if you measure it by the contortions a hater has to go through to avoid it.",Examples of good gotos in C or C++,16.0,9.0,245761.0,18167.0,2008-10-29 03:58:30,<c++><c><goto>,2014-02-11 19:42:09,1.0,3467.0

1430,286846.0,107.0,43278.0,"let's share java based web application architectures! there are lots of different architectures for web applications which are to be implemented using java. the answers to this question may serve as a library of various web application designs with their pros and cons. while i realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list. use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. for your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. and last but not least, when should we use your architecture? i'll start... overview of the architecture we use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from sun like java ee, java persistence api, servlet and java server pages. persistence business presentation the possible communication flows between the layers are represented by: persistence <-> business <-> presentation which for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. this architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application. persistence performs create, read, update and delete (crud) persistence operations. in our case we are using (java persistence api) jpa and we currently use hibernate as our persistence provider and use its entitymanager. this layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities (i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class) and is used by one and only one manager. in addition this layer also stores jpa entities which are things like account, shoppingcart etc. business all logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. this functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product on-line using her/his credit card. it could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game. this layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with @stateless to become a stateless session bean (slsb). each slsb is called a manager and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called accountmanager. when accountmanager needs to perform crud operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of accountmanagerpersistence, which is a class in the persistence layer. a rough sketch of two methods in accountmanager could be: ... public void makeexpiredaccountsinactive() { accountmanagerpersistence amp = new accountmanagerpersistence(...) // calls persistence layer list expiredaccounts = amp.getallexpiredaccounts(); for(account account : expiredaccounts) { this.makeaccountinactive(account) } } public void makeaccountinactive(account account) { accountmanagerpersistence amp = new accountmanagerpersistence(...) account.deactivate(); amp.storeupdatedaccount(account); // calls persistence layer } we use container manager transactions so we don't have to do transaction demarcation our self's. what basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the slsb method and commit it (or rollback it) immediately before exiting the method. it's an example of convention over configuration, but we haven't had a need for anything but the default, required, yet. here is how the java ee 5 tutorial from sun explains the required transaction attribute for enterprise javabeans (ejb's): if the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean’s method, the method executes within the client’s transaction. if the client is not associated with a transaction, the container starts a new transaction before running the method. the required attribute is the implicit transaction attribute for all enterprise bean methods running with container-managed transaction demarcation. you typically do not set the required attribute unless you need to override another transaction attribute. because transaction attributes are declarative, you can easily change them later. presentation our presentation layer is in charge of... presentation! it's responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building html pages and receiving user input through get and post requests. we are currently using the old servlet's + java server pages (jsp) combination. the layer calls methods in managers of the business layer to perform operations requested by the user and to receive information to show in the web page. sometimes the information received from the business layer are less complex types as string's and integers, and at other times jpa entities. pros and cons with the architecture pros having everything related to a specific way of doing persistence in this layer only means we can swap from using jpa into something else, without having to re-write anything in the business layer. it's easy for us to swap our presentation layer into something else, and it's likely that we will if we find something better. letting the ejb container manage transaction boundaries is nice. using servlet's + jpa is easy (to begin with) and the technologies are widely used and implemented in lots of servers. using java ee is supposed to make it easier for us to create a high availability system with load balancing and fail over. both of which we feel that we must have. cons using jpa you may store often used queries as named queries by using the @namedquery annotation on the jpa entity class. if you have as much as possible related to persistence in the persistence classes, as in our architecture, this will spread out the locations where you may find queries to include the jpa entities as well. it will be harder to overview persistence operations and thus harder to maintain. we have jpa entities as part of our persistence layer. but account and shoppingcart, aren't they really business objects? it is done this way as you have to touch these classes and turn them into entities which jpa knows how to handle. the jpa entities, which are also our business objects, are created like data transfer objects (dto's), also known as value objects (vo's). this results in an anemic domain model as the business objects have no logic of their own except accessor methods. all logic is done by our managers in the business layer, which results in a more procedural programming style. it's not good object oriented design, but maybe that's not a problem? (after all object orientation isn't the only programming paradigm which has delivered results.) using ejb and java ee introduces a bit of complexity. and we can't use purely tomcat (adding an ejb micro-container isn't purely tomcat). there are lots of issues with using servlet's + jpa. use google for more information about these issues. as the transactions are closed when exiting the business layer we can't load any information from jpa entities which is configured to be loaded from the database when it's needed (using fetch=fetchtype.lazy) from inside the presentation layer. it will trigger an exception. before returning an entity containing these kinds of fields we have to be sure to call the relevant getter's. another option is to use java persistence query language (jpql) and do a fetch join. however both of these options are a little bit cumbersome.",Describe the architecture you use for Java web applications?,10.0,3.0,286893.0,,2008-11-13 12:55:32,<java><architecture><java-ee>,2015-10-05 08:30:06,1.0,9754.0

update: i've tried the different solutions presented below. after exhaustive testing, i found that adding 0.5 to the result of math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine. the john carmack hack was faster, but it gave incorrect results starting at n=410881. however, as suggested by bobbyshaftoe, we can use the carmack hack for n < 410881. newton's method was a good bit slower than math.sqrt(). this is probably because math.sqrt() uses something similar to newton's method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in java. also, newton's method still required use of doubles. a modified newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (i want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than math.sqrt(). binary chop was even slower. this makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number. the one suggestion which did show improvements was made by john d. cook. you can observe that the last hex digit (i.e. the last 4 bits) of a perfect square must be 0, 1, 4, or 9. this means that 75% of numbers can be immediately eliminated as possible squares. implementing this solution resulted in about a 50% reduction in runtime. working from john's suggestion, i investigated properties of the last n bits of a perfect square. by analyzing the last 6 bits, i found that only 12 out of 64 values are possible for the last 6 bits. this means 81% of values can be eliminated without using any math. implementing this solution gave an additional 8% reduction in runtime (compared to my original algorithm). analyzing more than 6 bits results in a list of possible ending bits which is too large to be practical. here is the code that i have used, which runs in 42% of the time required by the original algorithm (based on a run over the first 100 million integers). for values of n less than 410881, it runs in only 29% of the time required by the original algorithm. private final static boolean isperfectsquare(long n) { if (n < 0) return false;

} return sqrt*sqrt == n; default: return false; } } notes: according to john's tests, using or statements is faster in c++ than using a switch, but in java and c# there appears to be no difference between or and switch. i also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values). then instead of either switch or or statement, i would just say if(lookup[(int)(n&0x3f)]) { test } else return false;. to my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. i'm not sure why. this is because array bounds are checked in java.",Fastest way to determine if an integer's square root is an integer,29.0,24.0,424936.0,18511.0,2008-11-17 13:43:21,<java><math><optimization><perfect-square>,,1.0,15951.0

(we are stuck with unix file permissions.) also, setup on cvs or svn is too hard. darcs is way easy to set up, but it's not obvious how you share things. darcs send (to send patches by email) seems promising but it's not clear how to set it up. the introductory documentation for git is not for beginners. like cvs setup, it's something i myself have trouble with. i'm soliciting suggestions for what source-control to use with beginning students. i suspect we can find resources to put a thin veneer over an existing system and to simplify existing documentation. we probably don't have resources to write new documentation. so, what's really easy to setup, commit, revert, and share changes with a partner but does not have to be easy to merge or to work at scale? a key constraint is that programming pairs have to be able to share work with each other and only each other, and pairs change every week. our infrastructure is linux, solaris, and windows with a netapp filer. i doubt my it staff wants to create a unix group for each pair of students. is there an easier solution i've overlooked?

(note i have not looked at weblocks or links extremely closely, i may just be misunderstanding how they are used). so the question is, for the database access portions (which i believe are pretty large) of web application, or other development requiring interface with a sql database we seem to be forced down one of the following paths: don't use functional programming access data in an annoying, un-abstracted way that involves manually writing a lot of sql or sql-like code ala links force our functional language into a pseudo-oop paradigm, thus removing some of the elegance and stability of true functional programming. clearly, none of these options seem ideal. has found a way circumvent these issues? is there really an even an issue here? note: i personally am most familiar with lisp on the fp front, so if you want to give any examples and know multiple fp languages, lisp would probably be the preferred language of choice ps: for issues specific to other aspects of web development see this question.",Are Databases and Functional Programming at odds?,9.0,7.0,330582.0,30529.0,2008-12-01 09:28:20,<sql><database><functional-programming><lisp>,,1.0,2945.0

(annoyance) comments cannot be viewed at all or added. you can't vote up or vote down. you can't select the accepted answer. (loss of functionality) of course none of the ajax stuff works. i don't have access to the line of editing tools above this entry box, and i can't see the preview as i type this. (inconveniences) so as far as i am concerned, turning your javascript off results in annoyances, loss of functionality, and inconvenience. i'm sorry for the handicapped people who have no javascript support, but i still don't get why so many of you are so religiously against using it. personally, i love what ajax and its beautiful interfaces and enhanced functionality are doing to the web. i try to add such features to my site and it annoys me when the anti-javascript people ask me - no, demand of me to take it out because they can't access them. but how many of you use stack overflow with javascript off? none i would expect. your answer would be that you turn it on for sites you trust like stack overflow. okay. if i make a site that uses ajax or javascript, then i'm fine with you turning it off until you decide to trust my site. but don't expect me to be required to give you all the functionality that i do to people who trust me. even stack overflow doesn't. if someone wants to embellish this idea, i'll give them the accepted answer. also see the question: is it worth it to code different functionality for users with javascript disabled? and my answer to that question (which, when i last looked, had been voted down by the do-not-use javascript people). followup. i found the following opinion about javascript at the wp-spamfree wordpress plugin page: ""most of the spam hitting your blog originates from bots. few bots can process javascript. few bots can process cookies. fewer still, can handle both. in a nutshell, this plugin uses a combo of javascript and cookies (on steroids) to weed out the humans from spambots, preventing 99%+ of automated spam from ever getting to your site. almost 100% of web site visitors will have these turned on by default, so this type of solution works silently in the background, with no inconveniences. there are extremely few users (less than 2%) that have javascript and/or cookies turned off by default, but they will be prompted to turn those back on to post their comment. stats show that among all internet users, less than 2% have javascript turned off, and less than 1% have cookies turned off. this requirement isn’t anything out of the ordinary because most modern websites require the use of javascript and cookies for key features — ajax, for example, won’t work if js is disabled. overall, the very few that might be inconvenienced because they have js and cookies turned off will be far fewer than the 100% who would be annoyed by captcha’s, challenge questions, and other validation methods.""",What's with those Do-Not-Use JavaScript People?,30.0,8.0,417533.0,30176.0,2008-12-17 06:40:42,<javascript><security>,2013-01-18 20:55:29,1.0,5460.0

(it apparently did, but it was marked obsolete, and was replaced by something much larger in scope.) what solutions, if any, are you guys using for this, and am i going to have to suck it up and roll my own exception for this? edit addenda some have asked whether or not i could provide a default value, and continue. in certain cases, yes, and in those cases, the exception would not be thrown. however, for certain settings, this won't apply. for instance: database server names and credentials, authentication servers, and paths to installed third party applications. it is also worth noting that the application i'm primarily working on is a console application running in batch mode, and i want it to throw an exception that is caught by the main method and logged appropriately if the thing isn't appropriately configured.

1709,458802.0,68.0,5171.0,"i'd like the community's take on some thoughts i've had about linq to sql and other orm mappers. i like linq to sql and the idea of expressing data access logic (or crud operations in general) in your native development tongue rather than having to deal with the ""impedance mismatch"" between c# and sql. for example, to return an objectdatasource-compatible list of event instances for a business layer, we use: return db.events.select(c => new eventdata() { eventid = c.eventid, title = c.title }) if i were to implement this using old sql-to-c# constructs, i'd have to create a command class, add the eventid parameter (using a string to describe the ""@eventid"" argument), add the sql query string to the command class, execute the command, and then use (cast-type)nwreader[""fieldname""] to pull each returned field value and assign it to a member of a newly created instance of my eventdata class (yuck). so, that is why people like linq/subsonic/etc. and i agree. however, in the bigger picture i see a number of things that are wrong. my sense is that microsoft also sees something wrong and that is why they are killing linq to sql and trying to move people to linq to entities. only, i think that microsoft is doubling-down on a bad bet. so, what is wrong? the problem is that there are architecture astronauts, especially at microsoft, who look at linq to sql and realize that it is not a true data management tool: there are still many things you cannot do easily of comfortably in c# and they aim to fix it. you see this manifested in the ambitions behind linq to entities, blog posts about the revolutionary nature of linq and even the linqpad challenge. and the problem with that is that it assumes that sql is the problem. that is, in order to reduce a mild discomfort (impedance mismatch between sql and c#), microsoft has proposed the equivalent of a space suit (full isolation) when a band-aid (linq to sql or something similar) would do just fine. as far as i can see, developers are quite smart enough to master the relational model and then apply it intelligently in their development efforts. in fact, i would go one further and say that linq to sql, subsonic, etc. are already too complex: the learning curve isn't that much different from mastering sql itself. since, for the foreseeable future, developers must master sql and the relational model, we're now faced with learning two query / crud languages. worse yet, linq is often difficult to test (you don't have a query window), removes us one layer from the real work we are doing (it generates sql), and has very clumsy support (at best) for sql constructs like date handling (e.g. datediff), ""having"" and even ""group by"". what is the alternative? personally, i don't need a different model for data access like linq to entities. i'd prefer to simply pop up a window in visual studio, enter and validate my sql, and then press a button to generate or supplement a c# class to encapsulate the call. since you already know sql, wouldn't you prefer to just enter something like this: select eventid, title from events where location=@location and end up with an eventdata class that a) contains the eventid and title fields as properties and b) has a factory method that takes a 'location' string as an argument and that generates a list? you'd have to think carefully about the object model (the above example obviously doesn't deal with that) but the fundamental approach of still using sql while eliminating the impedance mismatch appeals to me a great deal. the question is: am i wrong? should microsoft rewrite the sql infrastructure so that you don't have to learn sql / relational data management any more? can they rewrite the sql infrastructure in this way? or do you think that a very thin layer on top of sql to eliminate the pain of setting up parameters and accessing data fields is quite sufficient? update i wanted to promote two links to the top because i think that they capture important aspects of what i am after. first, codemonkey points out an article entitled ""the vietnam of computer science."" it takes a while to get started but is a very interesting read. second, ansgri points to one of joel spolsky's more prominent pieces: the law of leaky abstractions. it isn't exactly on topic but it is close and is a great read. update 2: i've given the ""answer"" to ocdecio although there are many great answers here and the choice of the ""right"" answer is purely subjective. in this case, his answer squared with what i think is truly the best practice given the current state of technology. this is an area that i fully expect to evolve, however, so things may well change. i'd like to thank everyone who contributed, i've upvoted everyone who i think gave a thoughtful answer.","Doesn't Linq to SQL miss the point?

1715,463105.0,152.0,18600.0,"this is a long text. please bear with me. boiled down, the question is: is there a workable in-place radix sort algorithm? preliminary i've got a huge number of small fixed-length strings that only use the letters “a”, “c”, “g” and “t” (yes, you've guessed it: dna) that i want to sort. at the moment, i use std::sort which uses introsort in all common implementations of the stl. this works quite well. however, i'm convinced that radix sort fits my problem set perfectly and should work much better in practice. details i've tested this assumption with a very naive implementation and for relatively small inputs (on the order of 10,000) this was true (well, at least more than twice as fast). however, runtime degrades abysmally when the problem size becomes larger (n > 5,000,000). the reason is obvious: radix sort requires copying the whole data (more than once in my naive implementation, actually). this means that i've put ~ 4 gib into my main memory which obviously kills performance. even if it didn't, i can't afford to use this much memory since the problem sizes actually become even larger. use cases ideally, this algorithm should work with any string length between 2 and 100, for dna as well as dna5 (which allows an additional wildcard character “n”), or even dna with iupac ambiguity codes (resulting in 16 distinct values). however, i realize that all these cases cannot be covered, so i'm happy with any speed improvement i get. the code can decide dynamically which algorithm to dispatch to. research unfortunately, the wikipedia article on radix sort is useless. the section about an in-place variant is complete rubbish. the nist-dads section on radix sort is next to nonexistent. there's a promising-sounding paper called efficient adaptive in-place radix sorting which describes the algorithm “msl”. unfortunately, this paper, too, is disappointing. in particular, there are the following things. first, the algorithm contains several mistakes and leaves a lot unexplained. in particular, it doesn’t detail the recursion call (i simply assume that it increments or reduces some pointer to calculate the current shift and mask values). also, it uses the functions dest_group and dest_address without giving definitions. i fail to see how to implement these efficiently (that is, in o(1); at least dest_address isn’t trivial). last but not least, the algorithm achieves in-place-ness by swapping array indices with elements inside the input array. this obviously only works on numerical arrays. i need to use it on strings. of course, i could just screw strong typing and go ahead assuming that the memory will tolerate my storing an index where it doesn’t belong. but this only works as long as i can squeeze my strings into 32 bits of memory (assuming 32 bit integers). that's only 16 characters (let's ignore for the moment that 16 > log(5,000,000)). another paper by one of the authors gives no accurate description at all, but it gives msl’s runtime as sub-linear which is flat out wrong. to recap: is there any hope of finding a working reference implementation or at least a good pseudocode/description of a working in-place radix sort that works on dna strings?",In-Place Radix Sort,15.0,11.0,463158.0,1968.0,2009-01-20 21:04:06,<algorithm><language-agnostic><sorting><radix-sort><in-place>,,1.0,4157.0

(end of edit 3) options i've come up with so far: add: common in .net, but implies mutation of the original list cons: i believe this is the normal name in functional languages, but meaningless to those without experience in such languages plus: my favourite so far, it doesn't imply mutation to me. apparently this is also used in haskell but with slightly different expectations (a haskell programmer might expect it to add two lists together rather than adding a single value to the other list). with: consistent with some other immutable conventions, but doesn't have quite the same ""additionness"" to it imo. and: not very descriptive. operator overload for + : i really don't like this much; i generally think operators should only be applied to lower level types. i'm willing to be persuaded though! the criteria i'm using for choosing are: gives the correct impression of the result of the method call (i.e. that it's the original list with an extra element) makes it as clear as possible that it doesn't mutate the existing list sounds reasonable when chained together as in the second example above please ask for more details if i'm not making myself clear enough... edit 1: here's my reasoning for preferring plus to add. consider these two lines of code: list.add(foo); list.plus(foo); in my view (and this is a personal thing) the latter is clearly buggy - it's like writing ""x + 5;"" as a statement on its own. the first line looks like it's okay, until you remember that it's immutable. in fact, the way that the plus operator on its own doesn't mutate its operands is another reason why plus is my favourite. without the slight ickiness of operator overloading, it still gives the same connotations, which include (for me) not mutating the operands (or method target in this case). edit 2: reasons for not liking add. various answers are effectively: ""go with add. that's what datetime does, and string has replace methods etc which don't make the immutability obvious."" i agree - there's precedence here. however, i've seen plenty of people call datetime.add or string.replace and expect mutation. there are loads of newsgroup questions (and probably so ones if i dig around) which are answered by ""you're ignoring the return value of string.replace; strings are immutable, a new string gets returned."" now, i should reveal a subtlety to the question - the type might not actually be an immutable list, but a different immutable type. in particular, i'm working on a benchmarking framework where you add tests to a suite, and that creates a new suite. it might be obvious that: var list = new immutablelist(); list.add(""foo""); isn't going to accomplish anything, but it becomes a lot murkier when you change it to: var suite = new testsuite(); suite.add(x => x.length); that looks like it should be okay. whereas this, to me, makes the mistake clearer: var suite = new testsuite(); suite.plus(x => x.length); that's just begging to be: var suite = new testsuite().plus(x => x.length); ideally, i would like my users not to have to be told that the test suite is immutable. i want them to fall into the pit of success. this may not be possible, but i'd like to try. i apologise for over-simplifying the original question by talking only about an immutable list type. not all collections are quite as self-descriptive as immutablelist :)","What's the best name for a non-mutating ""add"" method on an immutable collection?",74.0,50.0,,22656.0,2009-02-06 19:49:29,<language-agnostic><naming-conventions><list><immutability>,,1.0,6311.0

(note that if the argument(s) to daemonize is a script that runs forever as in case 1 above, then daemonize will still do the right thing, restarting it when necessary.) i could then put a command like above in my .login and/or cron it hourly or minutely (depending on how worried i was about it dying unexpectedly). nb: the daemonize script will need to remember the command string it is daemonizing so that if the same command string is daemonized again it does not launch a second copy. also, the solution should ideally work on both os x and linux but solutions for one or the other are welcome. edit: it's fine if you have to invoke it with sudo daemonize myscript myargs.

(jason zander even said himself that it wouldn't take much to implement one.) instead of the cute, dozen-so meg download of .net 1.0, we now have a massive 200-300 mb cross-platform complete .net 3.5 installer that contains versions of .net for x86, x64, and ia64. microsoft's suggestions to decrease the runtime size include: unpack the redistributable, remove the target platforms you don't want, and put it back together use the web bootstrapper that only downloads the libraries for your platform use the client profile installer (new as of late 2008) which has limited libraries and only works for x86 to make matters worse, as i understand it (please correct me if i'm wrong) the client profile don't even register with windows as having .net 3.5 installed. this means if multiple .net 3.5 client applications are installed on the computer, none will see each other and the runtime will be re-installed again and again! i really don't know what microsoft is thinking here. even assuming the worst case install will be for one target platform (eg, x64) and only those libraries need to be included, you're still looking at upwards of 60 mb overhead on your app. even one of the most well known .net apps, paint.net, was fraught with difficulties installing the application because of the massive .net dependencies. if they have problems distributing a free app, what about the rest of the world? in the end, they had to make a bootstrapper that installed microsoft installer 3.1, the .net runtime bootstrapper, and all their other dependent libraires before they could install their own application. so how about it. a linker. do any good ones exist - or a tool that simply makes it possible to build a c# application without requiring that the user install the massive .net runtime? update: so, it looks like there's a couple of options: mono: mono has its own linker. from the answer below, it looks like it works pretty well. .net: xenocode seems to be one that's available and works. thinstall is another that was recommended, and it's by vmware. there's another linker by remotesoft. they bill it as an 'obfuscator'. any thoughts there? found another by rustemsoft called skater .net obfuscator. anyone familiar with them? ilmerge by microsoft was also suggested; this looks like it only performs part of the task (ie, merging libraries, not stripping out unused bits). it looks like the mono tools are getting use; how about the .net based tools? any other experience with them, or are we just going to have to wait for microsoft to push it 3.5 out to everyone? i shudder to think how long it'll take for .net 4.0 to be put out...","The State of Linkers for .NET apps (aka ""Please Sir, May I have a Linker"" 2009 edition)",8.0,6.0,694631.0,18097.0,2009-03-20 22:07:04,<c#><.net><vb.net><mono><linker>,,1.0,4378.0

(let's call it a ""typically-long-running-but-sometimes-fast"" command, or tlrbsf for fun.) so this nifty 1-liner approach has a couple of problems. first, the sleep isn't conditional, so that sets an undesirable lower bound on the time taken for the sequence to finish. consider 30s or 2m or even 5m for the sleep, when the tlrbsf command finishes in 2 seconds — highly undesirable. second, the kill is unconditional, so this sequence will attempt to kill a non-running process and whine about it. so... is there a way to timeout a typically-long-running-but-sometimes-fast (""tlrbsf"") command that has a bash implementation (the other question already has perl and c answers) will terminate at the earlier of the two: tlrbsf program termination, or timeout elapsed will not kill non-existing/non-running processes (or, optionally: will not complain about a bad kill) doesn't have to be a 1-liner can run under cygwin or linux ... and, for bonus points, runs the tlrbsf command in the foreground and any 'sleep' or extra process in the background, such that the stdin/stdout/stderr of the tlrbsf command can be redirected, same as if it had been run directly? if so, please share your code. if not, please explain why. i have spent awhile trying to hack the aforementioned example but i'm hitting the limit of my bash skills.",Timeout a command in bash without unnecessary delay,16.0,1.0,687994.0,52963.0,2009-03-26 23:32:49,<bash><command-line><timeout><utilities>,,1.0,2153.0

2024,690419.0,117.0,67140.0,"what are current best-practices for systematic build numbering and version number management in java projects? specifically: how to manage build numbers systematically in a distributed development environment how to maintain version numbers in source / available to the runtime application how to properly integrate with source repository how to more automatically manage version numbers vs. repository tags how to integrate with continuous build infrastructure there are quite a number of tools available, and ant (the build system we're using) has a task that will maintain a build number, but it's not clear how to manage this with multiple, concurrent developers using cvs, svn, or similar. [edit] several good and helpful partial or specific answers have appeared below, so i'll summarize a few of them. it sounds to me like there is not really a strong ""best practice"" on this, rather a collection of overlapping ideas. below, find my summaries and some resulting questions that folks might try to answer as follow-ups. [new to stackoverflow... please provide comments if i'm doing this wrong.] if you are using svn, versioning of a specific checkout comes along for the ride. build numbering can exploit this to create a unique build number that identifies the specific checkout/revision. [cvs, which we are using for legacy reasons, doesn't provide quite this level of insight... manual intervention with tags gets you part way there.] if you are using maven as your build system, there is support for producing a version number from the scm, as well as a release module for automatically producing releases. [we can't use maven, for a variety of reasons, but this helps those who can. [thanks to marcelo-morales]] if you are using ant as your build system, the following task description can help produce a java .properties file capturing build information, which can then be folded into your build in a number of ways. [we expanded on this idea to include hudson-derived information, thanks marty-lamb]. ant and maven (and hudson and cruise control) provide easy means for getting build numbers into a .properties file, or into a .txt/.html file. is this ""safe"" enough to keep it from being tampered with intentionally or accidentally? is it better to compile it into a ""versioning"" class at build time? assertion: build numbering should be defined/enacted in a continuous integration system like hudson. [thanks to marcelo-morales] we have taken this suggestion, but it does crack open the release engineering question: how does a release happen? are there multiple buildnumbers in a release? is there a meaningful relationship between buildnumbers from differing releases? question: what is the objective behind a build number? is it used for qa? how? is it used primarily by developers to disambiguate between multiple builds during development, or more for qa to determine what build an end-user got? if the goal is reproducibility, in theory this is what a release version number should provide -- why doesn't it? (please answer this as a part of your answers below, it will help illuminate the choices you have made/suggested...) question: is there a place for build numbers in manual builds? is this so problematic that everyone should be using a ci solution? question: should build numbers be checked in to the scm? if the goal is reliably and unambiguously identifying a particular build, how to cope with a variety of continuous or manual build systems that may crash/restart/etc... question: should a build number be short and sweet (i.e., monotonically increasing integer) so that it's easy to stick into file names for archival, easy to refer to in communication, etc... or should it be long and full of usernames, datestamps, machine names, etc? question: please provide details about how the assignment of build numbers fits into your larger automated release process. yes, maven lovers, we know this is done and done, but not all of us have drunk the kool-aid quite yet... i'd really like to flesh this out into a complete answer, at least for the concrete example of our cvs/ant/hudson setup, so someone could build a complete strategy based on this question. i'll mark as ""the answer"" anyone who can give a soup-to-nuts description for this particular case (including cvs tagging scheme, relevant ci config items, and release procedure that folds the build number into the release such that it's programmatically accessible.) if you want to ask/answer for another particular configuration (say, svn/maven/cruise control) i'll link to the question from here. --ja [edit 23 oct 09] i accepted the top-voted answer because i think it's a reasonable solution, while several of the other answers also include good ideas. if someone wants to take a crack at synthesizing some of these with marty-lamb's, i'll consider accepting a different one. the only concern i have with marty-lamb's is that it doesn't produce a reliably serialized build number -- it depends on a local clock at the builder's system to provide unambiguous build numbers, which isn't great. [edit jul 10] we now include a class like the below. this allows the version numbers to be compiled into the final executable. different forms of the version info are emitted in logging data, long-term archived output products, and used to trace our (sometimes years-later) analysis of output products to a specific build. public final class appversion { // svn should fill this out with the latest tag when it's checked out. private static final string app_svnurl_raw = ""$headurl: svn+ssh://user@host/svnroot/app/trunk/src/appversion.java $""; private static final string app_svn_revision_raw = ""$revision: 325 $""; private static final pattern svnbranch_pat = pattern.compile(""(branches|trunk|releases)\\/([\\w\\.\\-]+)\\/.*""); private static final string app_svntail = app_svnurl_raw.replacefirst("".*\\/svnroot\\/app\\/"", """"); private static final string app_branchtag; private static final string app_branchtag_name; private static final string app_svnrevision = app_svn_revision_raw.replaceall(""\\$revision:\\s*"","""").replaceall(""\\s*\\$"", """"); static { matcher m = svnbranch_pat.matcher(app_svntail); if (!m.matches()) { app_branchtag = ""[broken svn info]""; app_branchtag_name = ""[broken svn info]""; } else { app_branchtag = m.group(1); if (app_branchtag.equals(""trunk"")) { // this isn't necessary in this so example, but it // is since we don't call it trunk in the real case app_branchtag_name = ""trunk""; } else { app_branchtag_name = m.group(2); } } } public static string tagorbranchname() { return app_branchtag_name; } /** answers a formatter string descriptor for the app version. * @return version string */ public static string longstringversion() { return ""app ""+tagorbranchname()+"" (""+ tagorbranchname()+"", svn revision=""+svnrevision()+"")""; } public static string shortstringversion() { return tagorbranchname(); } public static string svnversion() { return app_svnurl_raw; } public static string svnrevision() { return app_svnrevision; } public static string svnbranchid() { return app_branchtag + ""/"" + app_branchtag_name; } public static final string banner() { stringbuilder sb = new stringbuilder(); sb.append(""\n----------------------------------------------------------------""); sb.append(""\napplication -- ""); sb.append(longstringversion()); sb.append(""\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n""); return sb.tostring(); } } leave comments if this deserves to become a wiki discussion.","Build and Version Numbering for Java Projects (ant, cvs, hudson)",9.0,4.0,693169.0,83695.0,2009-03-27 16:18:51,<java><build><build-process><versioning>,,1.0,8882.0

2055,728434.0,66.0,14168.0,"background i am using interface-based programming on a current project and have run into a problem when overloading operators (specifically the equality and inequality operators). assumptions i'm using c# 3.0, .net 3.5 and visual studio 2008 update - the following assumption was false! requiring all comparisons to use equals rather than operator== is not a viable solution, especially when passing your types to libraries (such as collections). the reason i was concerned about requiring equals to be used rather than operator== is that i could not find anywhere in the .net guidelines that it stated it would use equals rather than operator== or even suggest it. however, after re-reading guidelines for overriding equals and operator== i have found this: by default, the operator == tests for reference equality by determining whether two references indicate the same object. therefore, reference types do not have to implement operator == in order to gain this functionality. when a type is immutable, that is, the data that is contained in the instance cannot be changed, overloading operator == to compare value equality instead of reference equality can be useful because, as immutable objects, they can be considered the same as long as they have the same value. it is not a good idea to override operator == in non-immutable types. and this equatable interface the iequatable interface is used by generic collection objects such as dictionary, list, and linkedlist when testing for equality in such methods as contains, indexof, lastindexof, and remove. it should be implemented for any object that might be stored in a generic collection. contraints any solution must not require casting the objects from their interfaces to their concrete types. problem when ever both sides of the operator== are an interface, no operator== overload method signature from the underlying concrete types will match and thus the default object operator== method will be called. when overloading an operator on a class, at least one of the parameters of the binary operator must be the containing type, otherwise a compiler error is generated (error bc33021 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/watt39ff.aspx) it's not possible to specify implementation on an interface see code and output below demonstrating the issue. question how do you provide proper operator overloads for your classes when using interface-base programming? references == operator (c# reference) for predefined value types, the equality operator (==) returns true if the values of its operands are equal, false otherwise. for reference types other than string, == returns true if its two operands refer to the same object. for the string type, == compares the values of the strings. see also code using system; namespace operatoroverloadswithinterfaces { public interface iaddress : iequatable { string streetname { get; set; } string city { get; set; } string state { get; set; } } public class address : iaddress { private string _streetname; private string _city; private string _state; public address(string city, string state, string streetname) { city = city; state = state; streetname = streetname; } #region iaddress members public virtual string streetname { get { return _streetname; } set { _streetname = value; } } public virtual string city { get { return _city; } set { _city = value; } } public virtual string state { get { return _state; } set { _state = value; } } public static bool operator ==(address lhs, address rhs) { console.writeline(""address operator== overload called.""); // if both sides of the argument are the same instance or null, they are equal if (object.referenceequals(lhs, rhs)) { return true; } return lhs.equals(rhs); } public static bool operator !=(address lhs, address rhs) { return !(lhs == rhs); } public override bool equals(object obj) { // use 'as' rather than a cast to get a null rather an exception // if the object isn't convertible address address = obj as address; return this.equals(address); } public override int gethashcode() { string composite = streetname + city + state; return composite.gethashcode(); } #endregion #region iequatable members public virtual bool equals(iaddress other) { // per msdn documentation, x.equals(null) should return false if ((object)other == null) { return false; } return ((this.city == other.city) && (this.state == other.state) && (this.streetname == other.streetname)); } #endregion } public class program { static void main(string[] args) { iaddress address1 = new address(""seattle"", ""washington"", ""awesome st""); iaddress address2 = new address(""seattle"", ""washington"", ""awesome st""); functionthatcomparesaddresses(address1, address2); console.read(); } public static void functionthatcomparesaddresses(iaddress address1, iaddress address2) { if (address1 == address2) { console.writeline(""equal with the interfaces.""); } if ((address)address1 == address2) { console.writeline(""equal with left-hand side cast.""); } if (address1 == (address)address2) { console.writeline(""equal with right-hand side cast.""); } if ((address)address1 == (address)address2) { console.writeline(""equal with both sides cast.""); } } } } output address operator== overload called equal with both sides cast.",Operator Overloading with Interface-Based Programming in C#,2.0,3.0,728511.0,2233.0,2009-04-08 03:32:13,<c#><.net><operator-overloading><equals>,,1.0,7979.0

2119,786383.0,187.0,62096.0,"i frequently hear/read the following advice: always make a copy of an event before you check it for null and fire it. this will eliminate a potential problem with threading where the event becomes null at the location right between where you check for null and where you fire the event: // copy the event delegate before checking/calling eventhandler copy = theevent; if (copy != null) copy(this, eventargs.empty); // call any handlers on the copied list updated: i thought from reading about optimizations that this might also require the event member to be volatile, but jon skeet states in his answer that the clr doesn't optimize away the copy. but meanwhile, in order for this issue to even occur, another thread must have done something like this: // better delist from event - don't want our handler called from now on: otherobject.theevent -= ontheevent; // good, now we can be certain that ontheevent will not run... the actual sequence might be this mixture: // copy the event delegate before checking/calling eventhandler copy = theevent; // better delist from event - don't want our handler called from now on: otherobject.theevent -= ontheevent; // good, now we can be certain that ontheevent will not run... if (copy != null) copy(this, eventargs.empty); // call any handlers on the copied list the point being that ontheevent runs after the author has unsubscribed, and yet they just unsubscribed specifically to avoid that happening. surely what is really needed is a custom event implementation with appropriate synchronisation in the add and remove accessors. and in addition there is the problem of possible deadlocks if a lock is held while an event is fired. so is this cargo cult programming? it seems that way - a lot of people must be taking this step to protect their code from multiple threads, when in reality it seems to me that events require much more care than this before they can be used as part of a multi-threaded design. consequently, people who are not taking that additional care might as well ignore this advice - it simply isn't an issue for single-threaded programs, and in fact, given the absence of volatile in most online example code, the advice may be having no effect at all. (and isn't it a lot simpler to just assign the empty delegate { } on the member declaration so that you never need to check for null in the first place?) updated: in case it wasn't clear, i did grasp the intention of the advice - to avoid a null reference exception under all circumstances. my point is that this particular null reference exception can only occur if another thread is delisting from the event, and the only reason for doing that is to ensure that no further calls will be received via that event, which clearly is not achieved by this technique. you'd be concealing a race condition - it would be better to reveal it! that null exception helps to detect an abuse of your component. if you want your component to be protected from abuse, you could follow the example of wpf - store the thread id in your constructor and then throw an exception if another thread tries to interact directly with your component. or else implement a truly thread-safe component (not an easy task). so i contend that merely doing this copy/check idiom is cargo cult programming, adding mess and noise to your code. to actually protect against other threads requires a lot more work. update in response to eric lippert's blog posts: so there's a major thing i'd missed about event handlers: ""event handlers are required to be robust in the face of being called even after the event has been unsubscribed"", and obviously therefore we only need to care about the possibility of the event delegate being null. is that requirement on event handlers documented anywhere? and so: ""there are other ways to solve this problem; for example, initializing the handler to have an empty action that is never removed. but doing a null check is the standard pattern."" so the one remaining fragment of my question is, why is explicit-null-check the ""standard pattern""? the alternative, assigning the empty delegate, requires only = delegate {} to be added to the event declaration, and this eliminates those little piles of stinky ceremony from every place where the event is raised. it would be easy to make sure that the empty delegate is cheap to instantiate. or am i still missing something? surely it must be that (as jon skeet suggested) this is just .net 1.x advice that hasn't died out, as it should have done in 2005?",C# Events and Thread Safety,14.0,4.0,786455.0,27423.0,2009-04-24 15:37:35,<c#><multithreading><events>,,1.0,5201.0

(i also think it's a good textbook.) i want an easy-to-understand fp language to illustrate ds concepts and that the students can use. most students will have had only one or two semesters of programming in java, at best. after looking at scheme, erlang, haskell, ocaml, and sml, i've settled on either haskell or standard ml. i'm leaning towards haskell for the reasons outlined below, but i'd like the opinion of those who are active programmers in one or the other. both haskell and sml have pattern matching which makes describing a recursive algorithm a cinch. haskell has nice list comprehensions that match nicely with the way such lists are expressed mathematically. haskell has lazy evaluation. great for constructing infinite lists using the list comprehension technique. sml has a truly interactive interpreter in which functions can be both defined and used. in haskell, functions must be defined in a separate file and compiled before being used in the interactive shell. sml gives explicit confirmation of the function argument and return types in a syntax that's easy to understand. for example: val foo = fn : int * int -> int. haskell's implicit curry syntax is a bit more obtuse, but not totally alien. for example: foo :: int -> int -> int. haskell uses arbitrary-precision integers by default. it's an external library in sml/nj. and sml/nj truncates output to 70 characters by default. haskell's lambda syntax is subtle -- it uses a single backslash. sml is more explicit. not sure if we'll ever need lambda in this class, though. essentially, sml and haskell are roughly equivalent. i lean toward haskell because i'm loving the list comprehensions and infinite lists in haskell. but i'm worried that the extensive number of symbols in haskell's compact syntax might cause students problems. from what i've gathered reading other posts on so, haskell is not recommended for beginners starting out with fp. but we're not going to be building full-fledged applications, just trying out simple algorithms. what do you think? edit: upon reading some of your great responses, i should clarify some of my bullet points. in sml, there's no syntactic distinction between defining a function in the interpreter and defining it in an external file. let's say you want to write the factorial function. in haskell you can put this definition into a file and load it into ghci: fac 0 = 1 fac n = n * fac (n-1) to me, that's clear, succinct, and matches the mathematical definition in the book. but if you want to write the function in ghci directly, you have to use a different syntax: let fac 0 = 1; fac n = n * fac (n-1) when working with interactive interpreters, from a teaching perspective it's very, very handy when the student can use the same code in both a file and the command line. by ""explicit confirmation of the function,"" i meant that upon defining the function, sml right away tells you the name of the function, the types of the arguments, and the return type. in haskell you have to use the :type command and then you get the somewhat confusing curry notation. one more cool thing about haskell--this is a valid function definition: fac 0 = 1 fac (n+1) = (n+1) * fac n again, this matches a definition they might find in the textbook. can't do that in sml!",Haskell or Standard ML for beginners?,8.0,7.0,813646.0,17312.0,2009-05-01 06:31:16,<haskell><functional-programming><sml><discrete-mathematics>,,1.0,4056.0

(hint: 'oooooo' makes a funny sound) so when i say speak, the right side is what to speak. and i get that from the inputbox. so when you do several things on a line, like: x = 14 + y; you need to be aware of the order of things. first we add 14 and y. then we put the result (what it evaluates to, or returns) into x. that's my goal, to have a bunch of these cool examples to demonstrate and teach the class while they have fun. i tried this example on my roommate and while i may not use this as the first lesson, she liked it and learned something. some cool mathematica programs that make beautiful graphs or shapes that are easy to understand would be good ideas and i'm going to look into those. here are some complicated actionscript examples but that's a bit too advanced and i can't teach flash. what other ideas do you have?",What is the coolest thing you can do in <10 lines of simple code?

i enjoyed all of them. this has been a lot of fun for me to run, and i hope it's been fun for both the entrants and the spectators. i came across this interesting post about trying to compress images into a twitter comment, and lots of people in that thread (and a thread on reddit) had suggestions about different ways you could do it. so, i figure it would make a good coding challenge; let people put their money where their mouth is, and show how their ideas about encoding can lead to more detail in the limited space that you have available. i challenge you to come up with a general purpose system for encoding images into 140 character twitter messages, and decoding them into an image again. you can use unicode characters, so you get more than 8 bits per character. even allowing for unicode characters, however, you will need to compress images into a very small amount of space; this will certainly be a lossy compression, and so there will have to be subjective judgements about how good each result looks. here is the result that the original author, quasimondo, got from his encoding (image is licensed under a creative commons attribution-noncommercial license): can you do better? rules your program must have two modes: encoding and decoding. when encoding: your program must take as input a graphic in any reasonable raster graphic format of your choice. we'll say that any raster format supported by imagemagick counts as reasonable. your program must output a message which can be represented in 140 or fewer unicode code points; 140 code points in the range u+0000–u+10ffff, excluding non-characters (u+fffe, u+ffff, u+nfffe, u+nffff where n is 1–10 hexadecimal, and the range u+fdd0–u+fdef) and surrogate code points (u+d800–u+dfff). it may be output in any reasonable encoding of your choice; any encoding supported by gnu iconv will be considered reasonable, and your platform native encoding or locale encoding would likely be a good choice. see unicode notes below for more details. when decoding: your program should take as input the output of your encoding mode. your program must output an image in any reasonable format of your choice, as defined above, though for output vector formats are ok as well. the image output should be an approximation of the input image; the closer you can get to the input image, the better. the decoding process may have no access to any other output of the encoding process other than the output specified above; that is, you can't upload the image somewhere and output the url for the decoding process to download, or anything silly like that. for the sake of consistency in user interface, your program must behave as follows: your program must be a script that can be set to executable on a platform with the appropriate interpreter, or a program that can be compiled into an executable. your program must take as its first argument either encode or decode to set the mode. your program must take input in one or more of the following ways (if you implement the one that takes file names, you may also read and write from stdin and stdout if file names are missing): take input from standard in and produce output on standard out. my-program encode output.txt my-program decode output.png take input from a file named in the second argument, and produce output in the file named in the third. my-program encode input.png output.txt my-program decode output.txt output.png for your solution, please post: your code, in full, and/or a link to it hosted elsewhere (if it's very long, or requires many files to compile, or something). an explanation of how it works, if it's not immediately obvious from the code or if the code is long and people will be interested in a summary. an example image, with the original image, the text it compresses down to, and the decoded image. if you are building on an idea that someone else had, please attribute them. it's ok to try to do a refinement of someone else's idea, but you must attribute them. guidelines these are basically rules that may be broken, suggestions, or scoring criteria: aesthetics are important. i'll be judging, and suggest that other people judge, based on: how good the output image looks, and how much it looks like the original. how nice the text looks. completely random gobbledigook is ok if you have a really clever compression scheme, but i also want to see answers that turn images into mutli-lingual poems, or something clever like that. note that the author of the original solution decided to use only chinese characters, since it looked nicer that way. interesting code and clever algorithms are always good. i like short, to the point, and clear code, but really clever complicated algorithms are ok too as long as they produce good results. speed is also important, though not as important as how good a job compressing the image you do. i'd rather have a program that can convert an image in a tenth of a second than something that will be running genetic algorithms for days on end. i will prefer shorter solutions to longer ones, as long as they are reasonably comparable in quality; conciseness is a virtue. your program should be implemented in a language that has a freely-available implementation on mac os x, linux, or windows. i'd like to be able to run the programs, but if you have a great solution that only runs under matlab or something, that's fine. your program should be as general as possible; it should work for as many different images as possible, though some may produce better results than others. in particular: having a few images built into the program that it matches and writes a reference to, and then produces the matching image upon decoding, is fairly lame and will only cover a few images. a program that can take images of simple, flat, geometric shapes and decompose them into some vector primitive is pretty nifty, but if it fails on images beyond a certain complexity it is probably insufficiently general. a program that can only take images of a particular fixed aspect ratio but does a good job with them would also be ok, but not ideal. you may find that a black and white image can get more information into a smaller space than a color image. on the other hand, that may limit the types of image it's applicable to; faces come out fine in black and white, but abstract designs may not fare so well. it is perfectly fine if the output image is smaller than the input, while being roughly the same proportion. it's ok if you have to scale the image up to compare it to the original; what's important is how it looks. your program should produce output that could actually go through twitter and come out unscathed. this is only a guideline rather than a rule, since i couldn't find any documentation on the precise set of characters supported, but you should probably avoid control characters, funky invisible combining characters, private use characters, and the like. scoring rubric as a general guide to how i will be ranking solutions when choosing my accepted solution, lets say that i'll probably be evaluating solutions on a 25 point scale (this is very rough, and i won't be scoring anything directly, just using this as a basic guideline): 15 points for how well the encoding scheme reproduces a wide range of input images. this is a subjective, aesthetic judgement 0 means that it doesn't work at all, it gives the same image back every time, or something 5 means that it can encode a few images, though the decoded version looks ugly and it may not work at all on more complicated images 10 means that it works on a wide range of images, and produces pleasant looking images which may occasionally be distinguishable 15 means that it produces perfect replicas of some images, and even for larger and more complex images, gives something that is recognizable. or, perhaps it does not make images that are quite recognizable, but produces beautiful images that are clearly derived from the original. 3 points for clever use of the unicode character set 0 points for simply using the entire set of allowed characters 1 point for using a limited set of characters that are safe for transfer over twitter or in a wider variety of situations 2 points for using a thematic subset of characters, such as only han ideographs or only right-to-left characters 3 points for doing something really neat, like generating readable text or using characters that look like the image in question 3 points for clever algorithmic approaches and code style 0 points for something that is 1000 lines of code only to scale the image down, treat it as 1 bit per pixel, and base64 encode that 1 point for something that uses a standard encoding technique and is well written and brief 2 points for something that introduces a relatively novel encoding technique, or that is surprisingly short and clean 3 points for a one liner that actually produces good results, or something that breaks new ground in graphics encoding (if this seems like a low number of points for breaking new ground, remember that a result this good will likely have a high score for aesthetics as well) 2 points for speed. all else being equal, faster is better, but the above criteria are all more important than speed 1 point for running on free (open source) software, because i prefer free software (note that c# will still be eligible for this point as long as it runs on mono, likewise matlab code would be eligible if it runs on gnu octave) 1 point for actually following all of the rules. these rules have gotten a bit big and complicated, so i'll probably accept otherwise good answers that get one small detail wrong, but i will give an extra point to any solution that does actually follow all of the rules reference images some folks have asked for some reference images. here are a few reference images that you can try; smaller versions are embedded here, they all link to larger versions of the image if you need those: prize i am offering a 500 rep bounty (plus the 50 that stackoverflow kicks in) for the solution that i like the best, based on the above criteria. of course, i encourage everyone else to vote on their favorite solutions here as well. note on deadline this contest will run until the bounty runs out, about 6 pm on saturday, may 30. i can't say the precise time it will end; it may be anywhere from 5 to 7 pm. i will guarantee that i'll look at all entries submitted by 2 pm, and i will do my best to look at all entries submitted by 4 pm; if solutions are submitted after that, i may not have a chance to give them a fair look before i have to make my decision. also, the earlier you submit, the more chance you will have for voting to be able to help me pick the best solution, so try and submit earlier rather than right at the deadline. unicode notes there has also been some confusion on exactly what unicode characters are allowed. the range of possible unicode code points is u+0000 to u+10ffff. there are some code points which are never valid to use as unicode characters in any open interchange of data; these are the noncharacters and the surrogate code points. noncharacters are defined in the unidode standard 5.1.0 section 16.7 as the values u+fffe, u+ffff, u+nfffe, u+nffff where n is 1–10 hexadecimal, and the range u+fdd0–u+fdef. these values are intended to be used for application-specific internal usage, and conforming applications may strip these characters out of text processed by them. surrogate code points, defined in the unicode standard 5.1.0 section 3.8 as u+d800–u+dfff, are used for encoding characters beyond the basic multilingual plane in utf-16; thus, it is impossible to represent these code points directly in the utf-16 encoding, and it is invalid to encode them in any other encoding. thus, for the purpose of this contest, i will allow any program which encodes images into a sequence of no more than 140 unicode code points from the range u+0000–u+10ffff, excluding all noncharacters and surrogate pairs as defined above. i will prefer solutions that use only assigned characters, and even better ones that use clever subsets of assigned characters or do something interesting with the character set they use. for a list of assigned characters, see the unicode character database; note that some characters are listed directly, while some are listed only as the start and end of a range. also note that surrogate code points are listed in the database, but forbidden as mentioned above. if you would like to take advantage of certain properties of characters for making the text you output more interesting, there are a variety of databases of character information available, such as a list of named code blocks and various character properties. since twitter does not specify the exact character set they support, i will be lenient about solutions which do not actually work with twitter because certain characters count extra or certain characters are stripped. it is preferred but not required that all encoded outputs should be able to be transferred unharmed via twitter or another microblogging service such as identi.ca. i have seen some documentation stating that twitter entity-encodes <, >, and &, and thus counts those as 4, 4, and 5 characters respectively, but i have not tested that out myself, and their javascript character counter doesn't seem to count them that way. tips & links the definition of valid unicode characters in the rules is a bit complicated. choosing a single block of characters, such as cjk unified ideographs (u+4e00–u+9fcf) may be easier. you may use existing image libraries, like imagemagick or python imaging library, for your image manipulation. if you need some help understanding the unicode character set and its various encodings, see this quick guide or this detailed faq on utf-8 in linux and unix. the earlier you get your solution in, the more time i (and other people voting) will have to look at it. you can edit your solution if you improve it; i'll base my bounty on the most recent version when i take my last look through the solutions. if you want an easy image format to parse and write (and don't want to just use an existing format), i'd suggest using the ppm format. it's a text based format that's very easy to work with, and you can use imagemagick to convert to and from it. edit log may 30: bounty deadline up, picked winner may 28: more precise details on deadline may 28: cleanup of links, mention ppm may 27: reorganized and cleaned up rules and guidelines;

(and of course showing off!) second question: the new hashset must be the ""this"" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism? third question: is this idiom too obscure to use in production code? summary: very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. on question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though i'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it). on question (1), the generated code should run quickly. the extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases. question (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. if i understand the answers, what's happening in dbi is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a ""this"" value referencing the instance being constructed. very neat. overall, dbi strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity. coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with arrays.aslist, varargs methods, google collections, and the proposed java 7 collection literals. newer jvm languages like scala, jruby, and groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with java. given that dbi clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, i'd probably shy away from it. however, i plan to spring this on a friend who's just gotten his scjp and loves good natured jousts about java semantics! ;-) thanks everyone!","Efficiency of Java ""Double Brace Initialization""?",14.0,3.0,924326.0,45935.0,2009-05-29 03:40:13,<java><performance><initialization>,,1.0,2664.0
2259,924472.0,97.0,23977.0,"i'm interested in exposing a direct rest interface to collections of json documents (think couchdb or persevere). the problem i'm running into is how to handle the get operation on the collection root if the collection is large. as an example pretend i'm exposing stackoverflow's questions table where each row is exposed as a document (not that there necessarily is such a table, just a concrete example of a sizable collection of 'documents'). the collection would be made available at /db/questions with the usual crud api get /db/questions/xxx, put /db/questions/xxx, post /db/questions is in play. the standard way to get the entire collection is to get /db/questions but if that naively dumps each row as a json object, you'll get a rather sizeable download and a lot of work on the part of the server. the solution is, of course, paging. dojo has solved this problem in its jsonreststore via a clever rfc2616-compliant extension of using the range header with a custom range unit items. the result is a 206 partial content that returns only the requested range. the advantage of this approach over a query parameter is that it leaves the query string for...queries (e.g. get /db/questions/?score>200 or somesuch, and yes that'd be encoded %3e). this approach completely covers the behavior i want. the problem is that rfc 2616 specifies that on a 206 response (emphasis mine): the request must have included a range header field (section 14.35) indicating the desired range, and may have included an if-range header field (section 14.27) to make the request conditional. this makes sense in the context of the standard usage of the header but is a problem because i'd like the 206 response to be the default to handle naive clients/random people exploring. i've gone over the rfc in detail looking for a solution but have been unhappy with my solutions and am interested in so's take on the problem. ideas i've had: return 200 with a content-range header! - i don't think that this is wrong, but i'd prefer if a more obvious indicator that the response is only partial content. return 400 range required - there is not a special 400 response code for required headers, so the default error has to be used and read by hand. this also makes exploration via web browser (or some other client like resty) more difficult. use a query parameter - the standard approach, but i'm hoping to allow queries a la persevere and this cuts into the query namespace. just return 206! - i think most clients wouldn't freak out, but i'd rather not go against a must in the rfc extend the spec! return 266 partial content - behaves exactly like 206 but is in response to a request that must not contain the range header. i figure that 266 is high enough that i shouldn't run into collision issues and it makes sense to me but i'm not clear on whether this is considered taboo or not. i'd think this is a fairly common problem and i'd like to see this done in a sort of de facto fashion so i or someone else isn't reinventing the wheel. what's the best way to expose a full collection via http when the collection is large?",Paging in a Rest Collection,12.0,3.0,924714.0,111878.0,2009-05-29 05:09:01,<http><rest><http-headers><pagination>,,1.0,4028.0

(2) is this a concept that the framework designers could consider changing or updating? i am thinking about using an event signature that utilizes a strong typed 'sender', instead of typing it as 'object', which is the current .net design pattern. that is, instead of using a standard event signature that looks like this: class publisher { public event eventhandler someevent; } i am considering using an event signature that utilizes a strong-typed 'sender' parameter, as follows: first, define a ""strongtypedeventhandler"": [serializableattribute] public delegate void strongtypedeventhandler( tsender sender, teventargs e ) where teventargs : eventargs; this is not all that different from an action, but by making use of the strongtypedeventhandler, we enforce that the teventargs derives from system.eventargs. next, as an example, we can make use of the strongtypedeventhandler in a publishing class as follows: class publisher { public event strongtypedeventhandler someevent; protected void onsomeevent() { if (someevent != null) { someevent(this, new publishereventargs(...)); } } } the above arrangement would enable subscribers to utilize a strong-typed event handler that did not require casting: class subscriber { void someeventhandler(publisher sender, publishereventargs e) { if (sender.name == ""john smith"") { // ... } } } i do fully realize that this breaks with the standard .net event-handling pattern; however, keep in mind that contravariance would enable a subscriber to use a traditional event handling signature if desired: class subscriber { void someeventhandler(object sender, publishereventargs e) { if (((publisher)sender).name == ""john smith"") { // ... } } } that is, if an event handler needed to subscribe to events from disparate (or perhaps unknown) object types, the handler could type the 'sender' parameter as 'object' in order to handle the full breadth of potential sender objects. other than breaking convention (which is something that i do not take lightly, believe me) i cannot think of any downsides to this. there may be some cls compliance issues here. this does run in visual basic .net 2008 100% fine (i've tested), but i believe that the older versions of visual basic .net through 2005 do not have delegate covariance and contravariance. [edit: i have since tested this, and it is confirmed: vb.net 2005 and below cannot handle this, but vb.net 2008 is 100% fine. see ""edit #2"", below.] there may be other .net languages that also have a problem with this, i can't be sure. but i do not see myself developing for any language other than c# or visual basic .net, and i do not mind restricting it to c# and vb.net for .net framework 3.0 and above. (i could not imagine going back to 2.0 at this point, to be honest.) can anyone else think of a problem with this? or does this simply break with convention so much that it makes people's stomachs turn? here are some related links that i've found: (1) event design guidelines [msdn 3.5] (2) c# simple event raising - using “sender” vs. custom eventargs [stackoverflow 2009] (3) event signature pattern in .net [stackoverflow 2008] i am interested in anyone's and everyone's opinion on this... thanks in advance, mike edit #1: this is in response to tommy carlier's post : here's a full working example that shows that both strong-typed event handlers and the current standard event handlers that use a 'object sender' parameter can co-exist with this approach. you can copy-paste in the code and give it a run: namespace csscrap.genericeventhandling { class publishereventargs : eventargs { // ... } [serializableattribute] public delegate void strongtypedeventhandler( tsender sender, teventargs e ) where teventargs : eventargs; class publisher { public event strongtypedeventhandler someevent; public void onsomeevent() { if (someevent != null) { someevent(this, new publishereventargs()); } } } class strongtypedsubscriber { public void someeventhandler(publisher sender, publishereventargs e) { messagebox.show(""strongtypedsubscriber.someeventhandler called.""); } } class traditionalsubscriber { public void someeventhandler(object sender, publishereventargs e) { messagebox.show(""traditionalsubscriber.someeventhandler called.""); } } class tester { public static void main() { publisher publisher = new publisher(); strongtypedsubscriber strongtypedsubscriber = new strongtypedsubscriber(); traditionalsubscriber traditionalsubscriber = new traditionalsubscriber(); publisher.someevent += strongtypedsubscriber.someeventhandler; publisher.someevent += traditionalsubscriber.someeventhandler; publisher.onsomeevent(); } } } edit #2: this is in response to andrew hare's statement regarding covariance and contravariance and how it applies here. delegates in the c# language have had covariance and contravariance for so long that it just feels ""intrinsic"", but it's not. it might even be something that is enabled in the clr, i don't know, but visual basic .net did not get covariance and contravariance capability for its delegates until the .net framework 3.0 (vb.net 2008). and as a result, visual basic.net for .net 2.0 and below would not be able to utilize this approach. for example, the above example can be translated into vb.net as follows: namespace genericeventhandling class publishereventargs inherits eventargs ' ... ' ... end class _ public delegate sub strongtypedeventhandler(of tsender, teventargs as eventargs) _ (byval sender as tsender, byval e as teventargs) class publisher public event someevent as strongtypedeventhandler(of publisher, publishereventargs) public sub onsomeevent() raiseevent someevent(me, new publishereventargs) end sub end class class strongtypedsubscriber public sub someeventhandler(byval sender as publisher, byval e as publishereventargs) messagebox.show(""strongtypedsubscriber.someeventhandler called."") end sub end class class traditionalsubscriber public sub someeventhandler(byval sender as object, byval e as publishereventargs) messagebox.show(""traditionalsubscriber.someeventhandler called."") end sub end class class tester public shared sub main() dim publisher as publisher = new publisher dim strongtypedsubscriber as strongtypedsubscriber = new strongtypedsubscriber dim traditionalsubscriber as traditionalsubscriber = new traditionalsubscriber addhandler publisher.someevent, addressof strongtypedsubscriber.someeventhandler addhandler publisher.someevent, addressof traditionalsubscriber.someeventhandler publisher.onsomeevent() end sub end class end namespace vb.net 2008 can run it 100% fine. but i've now tested it on vb.net 2005, just to be sure, and it does not compile, stating: method 'public sub someeventhandler(sender as object, e as vbgenericeventhandling.genericeventhandling.publishereventargs)' does not have the same signature as delegate 'delegate sub strongtypedeventhandler(of tsender, teventargs as system.eventargs)(sender as publisher, e as publishereventargs)' basically, delegates are invariant in vb.net versions 2005 and below. i actually thought of this idea a couple of years ago, but vb.net's inability to deal with this bothered me... but i've now moved solidly to c#, and vb.net can now handle it, so, well, hence this post. edit: update #3 ok, i have been using this quite successfully for a while now. it really is a nice system. i decided to name my ""strongtypedeventhandler"" as ""genericeventhandler"", defined as follows: [serializableattribute] public delegate void genericeventhandler( tsender sender, teventargs e ) where teventargs : eventargs; other than this renaming, i implemented it exactly as discussed above. it does trip over fxcop rule ca1009, which states: ""by convention, .net events have two parameters that specify the event sender and event data. event handler signatures should follow this form: void myeventhandler( object sender, eventargs e). the 'sender' parameter is always of type system.object, even if it is possible to employ a more specific type. the 'e' parameter is always of type system.eventargs. events that do not provide event data should use the system.eventhandler delegate type. event handlers return void so that they can send each event to multiple target methods. any value returned by a target would be lost after the first call."" of course, we know all this, and are breaking the rules anyway. (all event handlers can use the standard 'object sender' in their signature if preferred in any case -- this is a non-breaking change.) so the use of a suppressmessageattribute does the trick: [suppressmessage(""microsoft.design"", ""ca1009:declareeventhandlerscorrectly"", justification = ""using strong-typed genericeventhandler event handler pattern."")] i hope that this approach becomes the standard at some point in the future. it really works very nicely. thanks for all your opinions guys, i really appreciate it... mike",Event Signature in .NET -- Using a Strong Typed 'Sender'?,12.0,6.0,4279544.0,10429.0,2009-06-25 20:21:02,<c#><.net><vb.net><events><guidelines>,,1.0,12640.0

don't have several differences in one answer, please. and vote up the ones you know are correct, and down those you know are incorrect (or are subjective). also, differences in syntax is not interesting. we know python does with indentation what ruby does with brackets and ends, and that @ is called self in python. update: this is now a community wiki, so we can add the big differences here. ruby has a class reference in the class body in ruby you have a reference to the class (self) already in the class body. in python you don't have a reference to the class until after the class construction is finished. an example: class kaka puts self end self in this case is the class, and this code would print out ""kaka"". there is no way to print out the class name or in other ways access the class from the class definition body in python (outside method definitions). all classes are mutable in ruby this lets you develop extensions to core classes. here's an example of a rails extension: class string def starts_with?(other) head = self[0, other.length] head == other end end python (imagine there were no ''.startswith method): def starts_with(s, prefix): return s[:len(prefix)] == prefix you could use it on any sequence (not just strings). in order to use it you should import it explicitly e.g., from some_module import starts_with. ruby has perl-like scripting features ruby has first class regexps, $-variables, the awk/perl line by line input loop and other features that make it more suited to writing small shell scripts that munge text files or act as glue code for other programs. ruby has first class continuations thanks to the callcc statement. in python you can create continuations by various techniques, but there is no support built in to the language. ruby has blocks with the ""do"" statement you can create a multi-line anonymous function in ruby, which will be passed in as an argument into the method in front of do, and called from there. in python you would instead do this either by passing a method or with generators. ruby: amethod { |here| many=lines+of+code goes(here) } python (ruby blocks correspond to different constructs in python): with amethod() as here: # `amethod() is a context manager many=lines+of+code goes(here) or for here in amethod(): # `amethod()` is an iterable many=lines+of+code goes(here) or def function(here): many=lines+of+code goes(here) amethod(function) # `function` is a callback interestingly, the convenience statement in ruby for calling a block is called ""yield"", which in python will create a generator. ruby: def themethod yield 5 end themethod do |foo| puts foo end python: def themethod(): yield 5 for foo in themethod(): print foo although the principles are different, the result is strikingly similar. ruby supports functional style (pipe-like) programming more easily mylist.map(&:description).reject(&:empty?).join(""\n"") python: descriptions = (f.description() for f in mylist) ""\n"".join(filter(len, descriptions)) python has built-in generators (which are used like ruby blocks, as noted above) python has support for generators in the language. in ruby 1.8 you can use the generator module which uses continuations to create a generator from a block. or, you could just use a block/proc/lambda! moreover, in ruby 1.9 fibers are, and can be used as, generators, and the enumerator class is a built-in generator 4 docs.python.org has this generator example: def reverse(data): for index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1): yield data[index] contrast this with the above block examples. python has flexible name space handling in ruby, when you import a file with require, all the things defined in that file will end up in your global namespace. this causes namespace pollution. the solution to that is rubys modules. but if you create a namespace with a module, then you have to use that namespace to access the contained classes. in python, the file is a module, and you can import its contained names with from themodule import *, thereby polluting the namespace if you want. but you can also import just selected names with from themodule import aname, another or you can simply import themodule and then access the names with themodule.aname. if you want more levels in your namespace you can have packages, which are directories with modules and an __init__.py file. python has docstrings docstrings are strings that are attached to modules, functions and methods and can be introspected at runtime. this helps for creating such things as the help command and automatic documentation. def frobnicate(bar): """"""frobnicate takes a bar and frobnicates it >>> bar = bar() >>> bar.is_frobnicated() false >>> frobnicate(bar) >>> bar.is_frobnicated() true """""" ruby's equivalent are similar to javadocs, and located above the method instead of within it. they can be retrieved at runtime from the files by using 1.9's method#source_location example use python has multiple inheritance ruby does not (""on purpose"" -- see ruby's website, see here how it's done in ruby). it does reuse the module concept as a type of abstract classes. python has list/dict comprehensions python: res = [x*x for x in range(1, 10)] ruby: res = (0..9).map { |x| x * x } python: >>> (x*x for x in range(10)) at 0xb7c1ccd4> >>> list(_) [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] ruby: p = proc { |x| x * x } (0..9).map(&p) python 2.7+: >>> {x:str(y*y) for x,y in {1:2, 3:4}.items()} {1: '4', 3: '16'} ruby: >> hash[{1=>2, 3=>4}.map{|x,y| [x,(y*y).to_s]}] => {1=>""4"", 3=>""16""} python has decorators things similar to decorators can also be created in ruby, and it can also be argued that they aren't as necessary as in python. syntax differences ruby requires ""end"" or ""}"" to close all of its scopes, while python uses white-space only. there have been recent attempts in ruby to allow for whitespace only indentation http://github.com/michaeledgar/seamless","What does Ruby have that Python doesn't, and vice versa?",36.0,19.0,1113613.0,126214.0,2009-07-11 12:24:26,<python><ruby>,,1.0,9101.0

""hypertext"" is defined in one of the comments: when i [fielding] say hypertext, i mean the simultaneous presentation of information and controls such that the information becomes the affordance through which the user (or automaton) obtains choices and selects actions. hypermedia is just an expansion on what text means to include temporal anchors within a media stream; most researchers have dropped the distinction. hypertext does not need to be html on a browser. machines can follow links when they understand the data format and relationship types. i'm guessing at this point, but the first two points above seem to suggest that api documentation for a foo resource that looks like the following leads to tight coupling between client and server and has no place in a restful system. get /foos/{id} # read a foo post /foos/{id} # create a foo put /foos/{id} # update a foo instead, an agent should be forced to discover the uris for all foos by, for example, issuing a get request against /foos. (those uris may turn out to follow the pattern above, but that's beside the point.) the response uses a media type that is capable of conveying how to access each item and what can be done with it, giving rise to the third point above. for this reason, api documentation should focus on explaining how to interpret the hypertext contained in the response. furthermore, every time a uri to a foo resource is requested, the response contains all of the information needed for an agent to discover how to proceed by, for example, accessing associated and parent resources through their uris, or by taking action after the creation/deletion of a resource. the key to the entire system is that the response consists of hypertext contained in a media type that itself conveys to the agent options for proceeding. it's not unlike the way a browser works for humans. but this is just my best guess at this particular moment. fielding posted a follow-up in which he responded to criticism that his discussion was too abstract, lacking in examples, and jargon-rich: others will try to decipher what i have written in ways that are more direct or applicable to some practical concern of today. i probably won’t, because i am too busy grappling with the next topic, preparing for a conference, writing another standard, traveling to some distant place, or just doing the little things that let me feel i have i earned my paycheck. so, two simple questions for the rest experts out there with a practical mindset: how do you interpret what fielding is saying and how do you put it into practice when documenting/implementing rest apis? edit: this question is an example of how hard it can be to learn something if you don't have a name for what you're talking about. the name in this case is ""hypermedia as the engine of application state"" (hateoas).",Is That REST API Really RPC?

""foo"" : f(); // 2 } the compilers had no problem with //1 but barfed on //2 because the the types in the conditional operator are different. so the type of a throw expression does not seem to be void. so what is it? if you answer, please back up your statements with quotes from the standard. this turned out not to be so much about the type of a throw expression as how the conditional operator deals with throw expressions - something i certainly didn't know about before today. thanks to all who replied, but particularly to david thornley.","In C++, if throw is an expression, what is its type?",4.0,5.0,1213058.0,,2009-07-31 14:50:00,<c++><throw>,,1.0,1628.0
