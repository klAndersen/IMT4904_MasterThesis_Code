5,3036150.0,-6.0,1804.0,"I am sharing a tip with you all.Please add on to this discussion. JQuery helps faster page load than javascript. JQuery functions are fired when the related elements are loaded, instead of complete pageload. This is a common practice to call a javascript function when page is loaded like window.onload = function(){ alert(""Mindfire"") } or Inside of which is the code that we want to run right when the page is loaded. Problematically, however, the has_links code isn't run until all images are finished downloading (this includes banner ads). The reason for using window.onload in the first place is due to the fact that the HTML 'document' isn't finished loading yet, when you first try to run your code. To circumvent both problems, jQuery has a simple statement that checks the document and waits until it's ready to be manipulated, known as the ready event $(document).ready(function() { // Your code here });",How to run Javascript code before document is completely loaded (using jQuery),2.0,2.0,,364475.0,2010-06-14 09:28:21,<javascript><jquery>,2010-06-14 10:08:06,-1.0,1341.0

For instance, in a financial application one might want a type ""Dollar"", or in a graphics application one might want a type ""Vector"".

86,8997978.0,-7.0,901.0,"I'm building a Picture Loader which has two major abilities: 1) Loading pictures in a thread, and 2) Saving cached images. Since I implemented has_links , I have been noticing that a TsdJpgGraphic uses approximately 3 times as much memory as the TJpegImage . I'm not concerned about resolving how much it reserves, but rather to make sure my threads manage the memory properly. Specifications TPictureLoader is the main component for this system. Every time a picture needs to be loaded, a thread is spawned to acquire that image. When the image is available, an event is triggered providing this image in the form of a TBitmap . Component has a queue, and a limitation of how many threads can be active at once (via ActiveThreads property). Every picture requested immediately creates a thread - but the thread is not executed until necessary. ActiveThreads determines how many of these threads can run at a time (otherwise, how many pictures can be loaded at a time). Problem TJpegImage always loads the pictures fine with no errors. But, using a global conditional, I enable the use of NativeJpg ( TsdJpgGraphic ) and I have memory problems. The error message is Not enough storage is available to process this command . This error is raised only internally (in debug), and actually does not show any error when the app is running stand-alone. It doesn't go to any breakpoint in my code, but rather in the NativeJpg unit on line 460: FBitmap := SetBitmapFromIterator(AIterator); Using the standard TJpegImage , I never have problems with memory. Whether I load the picture once and then clear it from the memory, or load the picture once and save it somewhere in the memory, either way doesn't seem to make a difference. The strange thing is that my memory just about maxes out using TJpegImage yet never raises any error, but when using a TsdJpgGraphic , the memory barely nudges at all and it already starts spitting out these errors. When analyzing the memory usage, I'm seeing this... Question How do I avoid this error in any situation? This system will be used in many environments, many of which will be very sluggish computers. Especially since I'm working with multithreading here, memory usage is critical.

Is there any way that I can apply some equivalent of __get() and __set() to a Perl ""class"" that will remain completely encapsulated in that package, transparent to anything trying to actually get or set properties? EDIT: The best way to explain this may be to show you code, show the output, and then show what I want it to output. package AccessTest; my $test = new Sammich; #""improper"" style, don't care, not part of the question. say 'bacon is: ' . $test->{'bacon'}; say 'cheese is: ' . $test->{'cheese'}; for (keys $test->{'moreProperties'}) { say ""$_ => "" . $test->{'moreProperties'}{$_}; } say 'invalid is: ' . $test->{'invalid'}; say 'Setting invalid.'; $test->{'invalid'} = 'true'; say 'invalid is now: ' . $test->{'invalid'}; for (keys $test->{'moreProperties'}) { say ""$_ => "" . $test->{'moreProperties'}{$_}; } package Sammich; sub new { my $className = shift; my $this = { 'bacon' => 'yes', 'moreProperties' => { 'cheese' => 'maybe', 'ham' => 'no' } }; return bless($this, $className); } This currently outputs: bacon is: yes Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at ./AccessTest.pl line 11. cheese is: cheese => maybe ham => no Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at ./AccessTest.pl line 17. invalid is: Setting invalid. invalid is now: true cheese => maybe ham => no Now, I need to make modifications to Sammich only, without making any changes at all to the initial AccessTest package , that will result in this: bacon is: yes cheese is: maybe cheese => maybe ham => no invalid is: 0 Setting invalid. invalid is now: true cheese => maybe ham => no invalid => true As you can see, the desired effect is that the 'cheese' property, since it's not a part of the test object directly, would instead be grabbed from the 'moreProperties' hash. 'invalid' would attempt the same thing, but since it is neither a direct property nor in 'moreProperties', it would act in whatever way programmed - in this case, I would want it to simply return the value 0, without any errors or warnings. Upon attempting to set the 'invalid' property, it would not be added to the object directly, because it's not already there, but would instead be added to the 'moreProperties' hash. I'm expecting this to take more than the six or so lines it would require in PHP, but as it is a very important concept of OOP, I fully expect Perl to handle it somehow.",Perl - Overloading package/class properties?,4.0,7.0,,1145938.0,2012-06-08 13:12:54,<perl><oop><overloading><getter-setter>,,-1.0,3571.0

ViewController.h #import #import ""Model.h"" #import ""ViewController2.h"" @interface ViewController : UIViewController { NSString *text2pass; } @property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UITextField *tf; @property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UILabel *btn; - (IBAction)go:(id)sender; @end ViewController.m #import ""ViewController.h"" @interface ViewController () @end @implementation ViewController @synthesize tf = _tf; @synthesize btn = _btn; - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. NSString *tfstring = _tf.text; NSLog(@""string = %@"",tfstring); } - (void)viewDidUnload { [self setTf:nil]; [self setBtn:nil]; [super viewDidUnload]; // Release any retained subviews of the main view. } - (IBAction)go:(id)sender { NSLog(@""btn pressed""); UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@""MainStoryboard"" bundle:nil]; ViewController2 *vc2 = (ViewController2 *) [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@""home""]; text2pass = _tf.text; [self passValues]; [self presentModalViewController:vc2 animated:YES]; } -(void) passValues { Model *model = [Model sharedModel]; model.passedText = text2pass; } @end ViewController2.h #import #import ""ViewController.h"" @interface ViewController2 : UIViewController { NSString *passedText; } @property (nonatomic)NSString *passedValue; @property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UILabel *lbl; - (IBAction)back:(id)sender; @end ViewController2.m #import ""ViewController2.h"" @interface ViewController2 () { NSString *passedtext; } @end @implementation ViewController2 @synthesize lbl = _lbl; @synthesize passedValue = _passedValue; - (void)viewDidLoad { // do code stuff here NSLog(@""passedText = %@"",passedText); _lbl.text = passedText; [super viewDidLoad]; } - (void)viewDidUnload { [self setLbl:nil]; [super viewDidUnload]; // Release any retained subviews of the main view. } - (IBAction)back:(id)sender { UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@""MainStoryboard"" bundle:nil]; ViewController *vc = (ViewController *) [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@""welcome""]; [self presentModalViewController:vc animated:YES]; } @end Model.h #import @interface Model : NSObject { NSString *passedText; } @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString* passedText; + (Model *) sharedModel; @end Model.m #import ""Model.h"" @implementation Model @synthesize passedText = _passedText; static Model *sharedModel = nil; + (Model *) sharedModel { @synchronized(self){ if (sharedModel == nil){ sharedModel = [[self alloc] init]; } } return sharedModel; } @end The project can be downloaded in its entirety from here has_links If you know why the UILabel is not displaying the text field text let me know.

But anything larger than that, I get an error ""The application has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again."". Looking at LogCat, it seems the problem has to do with Android running out of memory. Is there a solution to this? Or is it just a matter of having to lower the resolution of my images down to the 200kb range? Surely the image size shouldn't matter much up to 1 or 2 megabytes?

406,15894912.0,-7.0,745.0,"According to points 3 and 4 of has_links , PATRICIA tries have two types of nodes: A (PATRICIA) trie is similar to a tree, but with the following differences: It explicitly views keys as a sequence of elements. E.g., a trie can view a string as a sequence of characters; a trie can view a number as a sequence of bits. It is not (necessarily) binary. Each node has fan-out n + 1, where n is the number of distinct elements. It stores values only at leaf nodes. Internal nodes have the properties that A) each has at least two children, and B) each shares the same prefix with any of its descendant. The book I've been reading (Algorithms in C, Parts 1-4 by Robert Sedgewick) seems to describe a PATRICIA trie storing n values with only n nodes, using internal nodes to store values: Like DSTs, patricia tries allow search for N keys in a tree with just N nodes. ... we avoid external nodes via another simple device: we store data in internal nodes and replace links to external nodes with links that point back upwards to the correct internal node in the trie I guess I'm concerned about the accuracy of my resources (edit: ... and these aren't the only two references in dispute on this topic).

Here is what I am doing: I have a mongoose pre-save middleware hook (for a mongo database) where the hook gets run every time a document is saved. At the point of save I check if the document was updated. If it was I set the crmIsUpToDate to false. The crmIsUpToDate will get set to true when a cron job gets. This hook can be run many times before the cron job gets to the document.

491,19312677.0,-9.0,4086.0,"Edit : An has_links to this algorithm been found. Your are welcome to see it. This question is the an improvement of my has_links question. Now I want to show you has_links , and explain my algorithm in more details. I think that I found a polynomial algorithm to get an exact solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem. My implementation is build from 5 steps: 1) Quick setup 2) Search for solution 3) Stop condition 1 4) Stop condition 2 5) Stop condition 3 I want to start from step 2 and 3, and if I do not get wrong there I will show you the rest of it. So what I am going to show you now, is not polynomial algorithm , but an improvement to has_links that solves the problem in time O(n^2 2^n) Lets say we want to solve a 6 cities route with the brout algorithm. There are (6-1)! = 120 options for that, we will need to test them all and return the shortest route founded. So it will look something like that(Cities names are: A, B, C, D, E, F): Option 1 : A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> A Option 2 : A -> B -> C -> D -> F -> E -> A Option 3 : A -> C -> B -> D -> E -> F -> A Option 4 : A -> C -> B -> D -> F -> E -> A . . Option 120 Now I am saying that after calculating option 1 and 2, you can skip over options 3 and 4. How do you do that? It's simple: When calculating option 1 you need to calculate what will be the shortest route starting from City D, finishing in City A, and going thru cities E, F, it actually calculating options 1 and 2. What we want to do is to build a map of 4 cities where we force what would be the first and the last city, in this example when calculating option 1 you create a map of D,E,F,A that holds the data of what would be the shortest path from D to A thru E,F. So now when you start calculating options 3 and 4 you can stop when reaching City D, because you already know what would be the shortest route starting at city D, finishing in City A and going thru cities E, F. This is the principle that I used in my algorithm. I run a brute algorithm and mapped all the sub results, those results are not sub routes , do not confuse there. They are just part of calculation that need to be done in order to find the shortest route. So each time I recognize I am doing the same calculation I used a solution from a map. Here is an output of my algorithm running over 19 cities. This is just one sample but it have a bigger meaning than that. In fact it represent all the results for 19 cities. No matter what 19 cities input will it be, the algorithm will always create the same amount of maps, perform the same amount of actions and will resolve with the same time.

You will need to see the code to understand this number better). Map(3) speaks about the number of maps with 3 cities that been created. It created 2448 3 cities maps and used them 34272 times. The number of maps that my algorithm will produce with K cities size in N cities route will be: The number of times I can select the first city of my map: N multiplies the number of times I can choose different selection of my cities from the remaining cities: (n-1)! / ((n - k - 1)! * (k-1)!).

So my algorithm have the next efficiency. N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) / 2! + N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) * (N - 3) / 3! + N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) * (N - 3) (N -4) / 4! + ... N! / (N - 1)! = N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) / 2! + N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) * (N - 3) / 3! + N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) * (N - 3) (N -4) / 4! + ... N So what kind of efficiency is this? It looks like exponential function of O(N^C*2^N) where C is just a bit smaller than one . I found this by solving the efficiency algorithm, with N from 7 to 100, and compare it to the previous results(result of N = 9 with N =8, result of N = 24 with N = 23) and I find out that for big numbers of N the comparison result is 2. Then I did the same with the traditional dynamic programing algorithm efficiency. Here is the list of what I got: Column 1 is N, column 2 is my algorithm efficiency compare, column 3 is dynamic programming algorithm compare and column 4 is my algorithm efficiency multiply N compare. 7 2.55769 2.72222 2.98397 8 2.40601 2.61224 2.74973 9 2.31562 2.53125 2.60507 10 2.2582 2.46913 2.50912 11 2.21972 2.42 2.44169 12 2.19258 2.38016 2.39191 13 2.17251 2.34722 2.35356 14 2.15701 2.31952 2.32293 15 2.14456 2.29591 2.29774 16 2.13424 2.27555 2.27652 17 2.12548 2.25781 2.25832 18 2.1179 2.24221 2.24248 19 2.11124 2.22839 2.22853 20 2.10533 2.21606 2.21614 21 2.10003 2.205 2.20503 22 2.09525 2.19501 2.19503 23 2.09091 2.18595 2.18596 24 2.08696 2.17769 2.17769 25 2.08333 2.17013 2.17014 26 2.08 2.1632 2.1632 27 2.07692 2.1568 2.1568 28 2.07407 2.15089 2.15089 29 2.07142 2.1454 2.1454 30 2.06896 2.1403 2.1403 31 2.06666 2.13555 2.13555 32 2.06451 2.13111 2.13111 33 2.0625 2.12695 2.12695 34 2.0606 2.12304 2.12304 35 2.05882 2.11937 2.11937 36 2.05714 2.11591 2.11591 37 2.05555 2.11265 2.11265 38 2.05405 2.10956 2.10956 39 2.05263 2.10664 2.10664 40 2.05128 2.10387 2.10387 41 2.05 2.10125 2.10125 42 2.04878 2.09875 2.09875 43 2.04761 2.09637 2.09637 44 2.04651 2.0941 2.0941 45 2.04545 2.09194 2.09194 46 2.04444 2.08987 2.08987 47 2.04347 2.0879 2.0879 48 2.04255 2.08601 2.08601 49 2.04166 2.0842 2.0842 50 2.04081 2.08246 2.08246 51 2.04 2.0808 2.0808 52 2.03921 2.0792 2.0792 53 2.03846 2.07766 2.07766 54 2.03773 2.07618 2.07618 55 2.03703 2.07475 2.07475 56 2.03636 2.07338 2.07338 57 2.03571 2.07206 2.07206 58 2.03508 2.07079 2.07079 59 2.03448 2.06956 2.06956 60 2.03389 2.06837 2.06837 61 2.03333 2.06722 2.06722 62 2.03278 2.06611 2.06611 63 2.03225 2.06503 2.06503 64 2.03174 2.06399 2.06399 65 2.03125 2.06298 2.06298 66 2.03076 2.06201 2.06201 67 2.0303 2.06106 2.06106 68 2.02985 2.06014 2.06014 69 2.02941 2.05925 2.05925 70 2.02898 2.05839 2.05839 71 2.02857 2.05755 2.05755 72 2.02816 2.05673 2.05673 73 2.02777 2.05594 2.05594 74 2.02739 2.05516 2.05516 75 2.02702 2.05441 2.05441 76 2.02666 2.05368 2.05368 77 2.02631 2.05297 2.05297 78 2.02597 2.05228 2.05228 79 2.02564 2.05161 2.05161 80 2.02531 2.05095 2.05095 81 2.025 2.05031 2.05031 82 2.02469 2.04968 2.04968 83 2.02439 2.04907 2.04907 84 2.02409 2.04848 2.04848 85 2.0238 2.0479 2.0479 86 2.02352 2.04733 2.04733 87 2.02325 2.04678 2.04678 88 2.02298 2.04624 2.04624 89 2.02272 2.04571 2.04571 90 2.02247 2.04519 2.04519 91 2.02222 2.04469 2.04469 92 2.02197 2.04419 2.04419 93 2.02173 2.04371 2.04371 94 2.0215 2.04324 2.04324 95 2.02127 2.04277 2.04277 96 2.02105 2.04232 2.04232 97 2.02083 2.04188 2.04188 98 2.02061 2.04144 2.04144 99 2.0204 2.04102 2.04102 100 2.0202 2.0406 2.0406 See how column 3 and 4 are almost the same.

540,21523867.0,-6.0,219.0,"I am new to C++ and memory management. I have a code that is to build up a graph composed of objects of type vertex(~100 bytes each) and edge(~ 50 bytes each). My code works fine when the graph is small, but with the real data that has ~ 3M vertexes and ~ 10M edges, I get the run time error: std::bad_alloc when ""new"" is used (and not always with the same new). This, based on what I have gathered, is the effect of memory leakage in my program that makes new memory allocation fail. My question is what is wrong with the way I am allocating memory and more importantly how can I fix it. Here is roughly what I do: In the graph class constructor I create the array repository for the objects of class vertex: graph:graph() { // vertexes is a class varaible vertexes = new vertex *[MAX_AR_LEN];// where MAX_AR_LEN = 3M } I then call a function like this to iteratively build obj vertexes and assign them to array. void graph::buildVertexes() { for(int i=0; i I then complete other tasks and at the end before the program ends I have a destructor that explicitly deletes the graph object graph:~graph() { delete[] vertexes; vertexes = 0; } Where is the leak happening. I am creating a lot of objects but nothing to my knowledge that could be deleted and remains undeleted. I have been dealing with this for over a week now with not much luck. Thank you very much for your help! EDIT (after solving the issue): Thanks all for the help. Looking back, with the info I provided it is hard to pinpoint what was going on. I solved the issues and here are the very obvious points that I took away; so obvious that might not worth sharing, but here they are anyway: When dealing with lots of objects that need to exist on the memory simultaneously, before coding use your best estimation to find the minimal memory you need. In my case even without a leakage, I would have almost maxed out on memory. I just needed better estimates of memory use to figure that out. As you go along developing your code, frequently using vld.h (or other alternatives) can be helpful in checking that your design is free of memory leakage. Doing this at the end could be a lot more complicated, and even if you find the leakage, it might be harder to fix. Let’s say you did all these and you expect to have enough memory to run the code but you get std::bad_alloc run time error when there seems to be plenty of free memory available on your system. You might be compiling for 32 bit platform, switching to 64 bit will allow allocation of more memory from what’s available (for has_links ). Use of vectors instead of arrays as suggested by many here is a helpful approach to avoid a common route for leakage (and for other conveniences), but let’s say you have memory leakage and you have arrays. As arrays are not necessarily the cause of leakage (obviously), switching to vectors might not serve you. Looking at array deletion though is a good start. Here is what I gathered for how to properly delete an array of pointers to objects: //Let's say we have objType **objAr = new objType[ aNum]; for(int i=0; i Ironically, a source of leakage in my code was improper deletion of a vector of pointers to objects. For vectors I needed to first delete element by element and then do a vec.clear().

563,22624307.0,-6.0,238.0,"In the beginning, there was C. And C had structure, and expressions, and functions to package them. And it was good. But C also had goto and switch case falling and syntax that followed use, so maybe not that good. It also had pointers, causing much gnashing of teeth from aliasing and pointer arithmetic! But it also had function pointers, allowing run time dispatch, and much rejoicing followed. Now, data could dictate code, as well as code dictating data, and both were First Class (or close). For anything that could be pointed to, could be pointed to, with the same pointer: the holy void*. And all were equal in it's glory. Then C++ came, and bound the data and the code into the Object. And lo, this was just syntactical sugar, for a function and a method are not so different, (no matter what the Sun or the Oracle may tell you). Obj->Foo(int val) being (approximately) the same as Foo(Obj* this, int val), they were still equal, under the holy void*. And then, with inheritance, came strife, as the outer Derived class may add to the inner Base. But lo, in these simple times, a solution was found: put every Base before Derived. Then, with the same pointer, we may point to both child and father. And still, anything that could be pointed to, could be pointed to with the holy void*. With the Virtual, we lost our simplicity, and wandered for ages. Wondering, how to deal with diamonds, or circles which are not quite ellipses. But even as we cast off our old tenants of C, with each instruction reducing to simple asm, we embraced, that some things should look simple (even if, under, they are complex). And so, we looked at the secret VTables that arose and thought ""good enough"". For while we had introduced hidden data, we had reduced complexity. And now, any call made through a Virtual was redirected through a VTable. And as all subobjects of a class could be pointed to through a single pointer, this was enough. But even though the dispatch method had changed, we could still point to all things, with holy void*. But then was made, what many in the present time, consider a grave mistake: Multiple Inheritance. And no longer would one pointer suffice! For how can both Base fathers be at the start? And no longer, then, would a VTable suffice, for how would we know which subobject to point to! And now, the problem of diamonds arises even worse than before, with no obvious solution, and our prior ones requiring current code to deal with future prospects! And so, pointer adjustments must be made, with each Virtual call. Because a Base class may really be a MI Derived class in disguise, and needs to be adjusted. So for the support of the Choice Few who used MI, we all paid a price. And suddenly, the holy void* could no longer store what had hither-forth been simple sugar. And what arose to deal with this complexity, was the dreaded member function pointer. The beast required it's own syntax, for none others would suffice. And this syntax, as rarely used, would be so low in precedence as to require parans with every use. Though in the holy Standard, what wicked council decided to allow such wretched things to be Cast, but when Cast from type to type, not Called without invoking behavior most undefined! And nay, decadent with syntax and greedy, they were Fat and could not fit into void*. As the only way to know what object to point to, was with an adjustment, nestled deep in the pointer, and checked with each VTable lookup. But this, brothers, is not how it must be. This complexity of implementation comes from a most peculiar of decisions. class Base1 { public: virtual void foo(); }; class Base2 { public: virtual void bar(); }; class Derived: public Base1, public Base2 { public: void unrelated(); } As is seen here, Derived* must be adjusted when calling foo() or bar(); it cannot point to Base1 and Base2 at the same time, as in the case of simple single inheritance. It is, indeed, impossible to properly predict how much of an offset is needed, when called from a base class, which is why most have some sort of mechanism for adding it into the vtable. However: class Derived: public Base1, public Base2 { public: void unrelated(); virtual void foo() { Base1::foo(); } virtual void bar() { Base2::bar(); } } Solves the problem, with nary a change to the original object model! As each method now exists, it can be added properly to the vtable, and when called, knows exactly how much to adjust the pointer, allowing the call to proceed without any mucking about! And now, both casting a member function pointer as well as calling it when cast, are well defined! And most importantly of all, anything that can be pointed to, can be pointed to by a holy void*. All a member function pointer need be is a normal function pointer that takes a special first parameter. And lo, things would have been pretty good. If only we lived in such a dream world. Unfortunately for us, we live with fat member function pointers, vtables that have to adjust each and every call, and member function pointers that cannot appropriately create delegates or many other useful patterns. In MSVC, they change size when you cast them! The problem is so great that std::function can allocate memory dynamically in most implementations, because of the various problems outlined here. The use of thunks for unoverriden methods, as I have detailed, would solve this problem quite handily, and the cost of this is a few inlinable hidden methods, and some vtable changes, along with a possible (but tiny) decrease in the speed of a virtual dispatch, in the case the function isn't overriden and also can't be inlined perfectly. And for this tiny negligible increase in speed and space, we've created a monstrosity in member function pointers, and influenced a half dozen other languages not to use multiple inheritance despite the easily solved problems, castrated member function pointers in use, and made our delegates slower. In fact, as noted in has_links , the current solution actually slows down every Virtual invocation; it forces extra checking, and extra memory usage, via fat pointers, which even for single inheritance, must store extra data (or risk losing it, as MSVC member function pointers can). This is clearly not in the ""pay if you use, not if you don't"" philosophy of C++! So, to reiterate, why are member function pointers different from ""loose"" function pointers? Is there any logical reason why they are not simply function pointers with a special calling convention, or with an extra argument for the ""this""?",Why are member function pointers different from normal function pointers in C++?,1.0,6.0,,3137484.0,2014-03-25 02:20:53,<c++><oop><multiple-inheritance><language-lawyer><member-function-pointers>,2014-03-25 02:55:30,-1.0,7578.0

In my case, I rarely achieve more than a three-fold improvement in speed partly because I try to take advantage of MatLab's efficient matrix computation, but mainly because, doing computer vision, half of the functions I run are MEX files :D, so that's not a point of reference either. What is your average speed gain when you compare pure MatLab code (written in a sensible way!) to C or C++? edit: I am not asking for a general comparison between the two languages, I know that wouldn't make sense, but rather about YOUR particular case, in YOUR application under YOUR implementation.

(first one shows messages from both sides, second one is used to type in a new message) The following command clears the edit box. (see SetFocus below) I don't want that. This behaviour changed from windows xp to windows 7 or between delphi versions not sure which. Last time I looked at this I think it may have been a changed in windows versions, delphi's edit box may have been implemented with windows apis. It didn't use to do that on windows xp and/or previous versions of Delphi. The problem is with: vActiveControl.SetFocus; This clears the edit box... I don't want that. This is a problem when the user is entering a new message and a message arrives from the other side... the code switches focus back and forth between rich edit messages and edit box.. which causes the newly typed message to be cleared, which is ofcourse annoying. (One possible solution which comes to mind is remembering what was typed and re-pasting it after this flip flop happens) Focus must be set back to this edit box after the rich edit chatter messages were updated. So that the user can continue typing in new messages. Is there an easy fix ? (Perhaps the remember trick and repasting might work, perhaps there are other solutions) It would also be nice if the rich edit chatter messages would auto scroll down without requiring focus... now focus flip flops between chatter messages, and chatter edit box to type new message. If user wanted to enter messages real fast... it might end up in the rich edit box cause the set focus back to chat edit box didnt happen fast enough.. I may try and replace vcl with firemonkey... I am not sure if firemonkey has better support for writing network chat apps and focussing and text scrolling and such. I may investigate that also. Copy & paste for text is also nice. (It would be preferred if fixes work across windows versions, perhaps the remember and repaste trick might work, I am aware that firemonkey may not work on all windows versions, I am considering to make a dual version, one vcl and one firemonkey version.) procedure TFormMain.ChatterMessageReceived( Sender : TObject ); var vActiveControl : TWinControl; begin vActiveControl := Screen.ActiveControl; // RichEditChatterMessages.Lines.Add( ProtocolWrapper.Chatter.OtherNickname + ': ' + ProtocolWrapper.Chatter.OtherMessage ); RichEditChatterMessages.Lines.Add( 'Remote: ' + ProtocolWrapper.Chatter.OtherMessage ); // RichEditChatterMessages.Perform(EM_LineScroll, 0, RichEditChatterMessages.Lines.Count); // werkt niet goed if ColoredPageControl1.ActivePage = ColoredTabSheetChatter then begin RichEditChatterMessages.SetFocus; // must set focus first for perform scroll caret to work end; RichEditChatterMessages.Perform (em_scrollcaret,0,0); if vActiveControl <> nil then begin vActiveControl.SetFocus; end; ColoredTabSheetChatter.TabColor := clLime; FlashApplication; end; The internet has been updated since I discovered this problem. I came across this solution which seems to work so far... will have to test on different windows versions and situations and such... looks promising, deleting this question for now, cause it might be a duplicate already: procedure ScrollToEnd(ARichEdit: TRichEdit); var isSelectionHidden: Boolean; begin with ARichEdit do begin SelStart := Perform(Messages.EM_LINEINDEX, Lines.Count, 0);//Set caret at end isSelectionHidden := HideSelection; try HideSelection := False; Perform(Messages.EM_SCROLLCARET, 0, 0); // Scroll to caret finally HideSelection := isSelectionHidden; end; end; end; procedure TFormMain.ChatterMessageReceived( Sender : TObject ); begin // RichEditChatterMessages.Lines.Add( ProtocolWrapper.Chatter.OtherNickname + ': ' + ProtocolWrapper.Chatter.OtherMessage ); RichEditChatterMessages.Lines.Add( 'Remote: ' + ProtocolWrapper.Chatter.OtherMessage ); ScrollToEnd(RichEditChatterMessages); ColoredTabSheetChatter.TabColor := clLime; FlashApplication; end; I am undeleting this question though. This solution has other drawbacks though. User might not be able to select text anymore if other user is chatting. Also it seems to raise exceptions. (Not sure why, maybe it happens when user tries to select text, or maybe the cause of the exception was from something else... investigating...) This is one nasty problem... I think the solution is to use a solution that works for whatever version of RichEdit dll delphi is using. This creates a bit of a tricky situation... if one wants to write code that works in all delphi versions... For now just using this seems to work in Delphi XE6: Perform(Messages.EM_SCROLLCARET, 0, 0); // Scroll to caret I may have to use {$ifdef } here and there if I want this code to work for all delphi versions... So I may again have to investigate this problem in the future. Here is a nice link to microsoft document about this control: has_links There are 4 versions: •Versions of Rich Edit ◦Rich Edit Version 1.0 ◦Rich Edit Version 2.0 ◦Rich Edit Version 3.0 ◦Rich Edit Version 4.1 I am not sure which Delphi versions use which control version. And which version of the control has the scroll issue... To be continued... (For now I ll focus on Delphi XE6 and perhaps in the future return to this issue if I want my software to work on different windows versions and delphi versions) This could be a cool solution: has_links ^ Detecting at runtime which version of the control is being used by any delphi version. Then coding a solution per control version, that would be nice. Further hints: ComCtrls unit has this code which determines which version is being loaded: RichEditModuleName = 'RICHED20.DLL'; Maybe it's possible to replace rich edit with simply a Tmemo... or maybe not... maybe Tmemo doesn't scroll or maybe it's the same kind of control... or didn't look good... not sure why rich edit was preferred. I think I was worried Tmemo can only contain a limited ammount of lines ? This perform solution is also not very good. If the user switches focus to other controls... it will interfere with the carrot of those controls. Woops forgot to include RichEditControl.. Instead of: Perform(Messages.EM_SCROLLCARET, 0, 0); // Scroll to caret This code works better: RichEditChatterMessages.Perform(Messages.EM_SCROLLCARET, 0, 0); // Scroll to caret Performance monitoring control was refreshing itself so was also not a good way to test this effect... so far so good. Perhaps switching to a better GUI like firemonkey might be a solution. Though perhaps firemonkey would introduce new problems, seeing all these problems with vcl/richedit... it's worth a try. Though firemonkey... not sure which windows versions that would work on... For now still interesting to investigate vcl/richedit and so forth for old os-es and such. Also what has not yet been discussed is why Tedit is clear when it receives .SetFocus... hmm... The problem was found by one of the commentors below. TEdit.AutoSelect property when set to True creates this clearing behaviour... see test code below provided by ""despatcher"". One remaining problem that remains is... the richedit does not scroll if it's not visible/in focus or something... so for example another tab is visible. I tried using .SetFocus on the richedit but doesn't seem to help... actually there was a branch in front of it... it will only set focus if tab was selected by user... therefore SetFocus was not being applied... hmm... ofcourse I can't interrupt the user with a setfocus like that anyway... hmmm... so setfocus is probably out of the question... must find a different way to scroll the richedit downwards so its nicely position on most recent messages or so... hmmm... Ok finally all problems solved: SendMessage(RichEditChatterMessages.Handle, WM_VSCROLL, SB_BOTTOM, 0); Works perfectly for scrolling down... as long as all event handlers use this method for the rich edit.",SetFocus clears edit box.

630,24414470.0,-7.0,567.0,"REGARDING MY QUESTION: I had an assignment in school, which i failed, because my code ran too slow. And now i have to fix and study it, because i will have to explain it how i fixed it and how it works. My question is: What parts of my code can i fix to archive an average performance of O(n^2)? How can i make it run faster? What is required: sort an array of integers in an ascending order, the algorithm must have an average performance of O(n^2), the Sort() method of array must not be used, System.Collections.Generic or other libraries are not allowed (only the system library is allowed), strand sort algorithm must be used, This is what i tried so far, but it works way too slow... I have to sort like 200000 numbers: EDIT: this code doesn't work proper. I posted an updated version below. static public int[] StrandSortAscending(int[] p1) { int[] p2, p3; int p1s1, p2s1, p2s2, p3s1, p3s2, n; p2 = new int[p1.Length]; p3 = new int[p1.Length]; Reset(ref p2); Reset(ref p3); p1s1 = p1.Length; p3s1 = 0; while (p1s1 != 0) { n = int.MinValue; p2s1 = 0; for (int i8 = 0; i8 < p1.Length; i8++) { if (p1[i8] != int.MaxValue) { if (p1[i8] >= n) { p2[p2s1] = p1[i8]; n = p1[i8]; p1[i8] = int.MaxValue; p1s1--; p2s1++; } } } int p3p, zs; bool pn = false; for (int i5 = 0; i5 < p2.Length; i5++) { p3p = int.MinValue; for (int i6 = 0; i6 < p3.Length; i6++) { if (pn) { zs = p3[i6]; p3[i6] = p3p; p3p = zs; } else { if (p2[i5] >= p3p && p2[i5] <= p3[i6]) { p3p = p3[i6]; p3[i6] = p2[i5]; } } } } Reset(ref p2); } return p3; } static void Reset(ref int[] a) { for (int i = 0; i < a.Length; i++) a[i] = int.MaxValue; } The wikipedia link to the strand sort algorithm: has_links NOTE: My biggest mistake with this algorithm was, that i forgot that an array is a reference data type. And 2 arrays pointed to the same one in memory. I spend most of the time figuring out this problem. I was like... What the hell is wrong here... And then it finally clicked. :) UPDATE (i have done some upgrades): i got the merging algorithm idea here: has_links static public int[] StrandSortAscending2(int[] np) { int[] up = new int[np.Length]; // sorted array int[] zp = new int[np.Length]; // temporary array int[] nnp = new int[np.Length]; // new unsorted array int[] sp = new int[np.Length]; // merged sorted array int dvup = 0; // the length of non-empty elements of the sorted array int dvnp = np.Length; // the length of non-empty elements of the unsorted array //0. repeat until the unsorted array isn't empty while (dvnp > 0) { //NOTE: reference data type. 2 arrays point to the same array/table in memoty (RAM), //from the previous cycle, that's why the values in unsorted array (and temp and merged array) were wrong... zp = new int[np.Length]; nnp = new int[np.Length]; sp = new int[np.Length]; //these counters are needed for knowing till which index of an array are the elements not-empty //so that i don't need to always increase and decrease the size of an array, but just overwrite the old values //the algorithm must not be slow, the higher memory usage is not a problem int dvzp = 0; // the length of non-empty elements of the temporary array int dvnnp = 0; // the length of non-empty elements of the new unsorted array //1.1 fill the temporary and the new unsorted array with values //1.2 the unsorted array should point then to the new unsorted array int nszp = int.MinValue; // biggest number of the temporary array for (int inp = 0; inp < dvnp; inp++) // index of unsorted array { if (inp == 0 || np[inp] > nszp) { nszp = np[inp]; zp[dvzp++] = np[inp]; } else { nnp[dvnnp++] = np[inp]; } } np = nnp; dvnp = dvnnp; //2. merge temporary and sorted arrays int izp = 0; // index/counter of temporary array int iup = 0; // index/counter of sorted array int isp = 0; // index/counter of merged array if (dvup > 0) { while (izp < dvzp && iup < dvup) { if (zp[izp] < up[iup]) sp[isp++] = zp[izp++]; else sp[isp++] = up[iup++]; } //if there are still numbers left in the temporary array //then add then all to the merged array //they are all bigger then the ones already in the merged array while (izp < dvzp) sp[isp++] = zp[izp++]; //do the same for the sorted array while (iup < dvup) sp[isp++] = up[iup++]; // dfdfgdgd up = sp; dvup = isp; } else { up = zp; dvup = dvzp; } } return up; } Could i improve the performance even more?

I have the word be chosen at random from a list of all words from the English dictionary, and whenever I get a word with multiple letters (apple, cookie, balloon) it only uncovers the first occurrence of that letter. The code is about 100 lines, so I put it on pastebin for convenience: has_links I've tried a few ways of doing it, but none of the ideas I've had have come to fruition. Some of my ideas as follows: Use a for loop to add each word to a list. If the next character iteration is in that list... (lost here) Make a method return true or false depending on if the guessed character is found more than once in the word (Then what?) A few other incomplete ideas There's gotta be a way to do it. If you want an idea of what im talking about, just set the word variable in my code to a string with multiple letters. Any help would be much appreciated! PS: I dont understand the lines of code that are go along the lines of: if (a = x for i in q[1].append) [terrible example] or otherwise complicated code.

For example, has_links . has_links lists null among primitive values and states that it is: a special keyword denoting a null value; null is also a primitive value (The above emphasis is mine) My last reference will be to has_links book by Eric Elliott, which in its has_links says the following: In JavaScript, ... even primitive types get the object treatment when you refer to them with the property access notations. They get automatically wrapped with an object so that you can call their prototype methods. Primitive types behave like objects when you use the property access notations , but you can't assign new properties to them. Primitives get wrapped with an object temporarily, and then that object is immediately thrown away. Any attempt to assign values to properties will seem to succeed, but subsequent attempts to access that new property will fail. And indeed the following statements will execute without a problem: ""1"".value = 1; (1).value = ""1""; false.value = ""FALSE""; while his one null.value = ""Cannot set property of null""; throws Uncaught TypeError .

What about (__ \ fieldName) ? After a lot of digging Play Doc, I came to a (shaky) conclusion that it produces an instance of JsPath? How did I arrive to that conclusion? It's for that .write[T] that follows; JsPath has that method. Beside, I read somewhere that __ is a shortcut for JsPath (I forgot where, I guess it's in Play Doc as well, but using Scala doc it's almost impossible to find my way back to that page). Ok..., so (writes ~ (__ \ fieldName).write[T]) produces an instance of OWrites . Next: what's this?: ((a: A) => (a, field(a))) Oh..., it's for the apply the parameter to the ""apply"" method of OWrites; it takes an lambda function with the following signature ((A) => JsObject) Ok...., so.... (a, field(a)) is supposed to create an instance of JsObject . So, I opened the play doc, JsObject . Hmm..., I guess it's this constructor (?): JsObject(fields: Seq[(String, JsValue)]) .... But,...

757,27639100.0,-7.0,66.0,"I'm trying to add two square ads to the right of the image on the web-site. The idea is to make this responsive like this: has_links Is this possible to achieve using CSS? I use inline-block to position ads to the right and max-width: 100% to scale the image. I need the support of IE 9+ and mobile browsers. I tried different approaches, don't even know which code example to show. It is relatively easy to position ads to the right of the image using inline-block : div{ border: 2px solid; } #img,#container{ display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; } #ad1, #ad2{ width: 30px; height: 30px; color: red; } #img{ width: 100px; height: 150px; max-width: 100%; color: purple; } ad1 ad2 has_links Yet in this case I won't get desired view on narrow screens. Also, since max-width: 100%; is used for #img this div would cover #ad1 and #ad2 on narrow screens. To achieve desired mobile view I had to change HTML to the following: div{ border: 2px solid; display: inline-block; } #ad1, #ad2{ width: 30px; height: 30px; color: red; vertical-align: top; } #img{ width: 100px; height: 150px; max-width: 100%; color: purple; } ad1 ad2 has_links In this case I didn't really know how to position #ad1 to the right of the #img . I gave a try to absolute positioning, it did not work. Flex also seemed not to be an option due to compatibility reasons.

However I need to connect my iPad to a local device with an IP address of 192.168.10.11 that is hardwired into my network. So I manually set the iPad to a static IP of 192.168.10.12, for the connected SSID of my Wi-Fi network. When I do this (using a network utility) I can ping 192.168.10.11 from the iPad, and I thought all was good and happy. However with this configuration the Wi-Fi icon on the iPad is not displayed. From what I understand this means that even though I am connected to a network of sorts, the iPad disagrees with me, and that this because the SCNetworkReachability system can't find what it needs to determine connectivity. But a commercial program I will be using on the iPad uses the Reachability system to determine network availability, hence I somehow need to beat the iPad into submission. From has_links IMPORTANT: Reachability must use DNS to resolve the host name before it can determine the Reachability of that host, and this may take time on certain network connections. Because of this, the API will return NotReachable until name resolution has completed. This delay may be visible in the interface on some networks. It seems that I need to add some sort of DNS information to keep the iPad happy. However ultimately this all needs to run on an isolated network, thus there will be no external connectivity. So my question comes down to: What sort of DNS configuration (and where), is needed to convince the SCNetworkReachability system that all is well with the network?",iOS static IP Address and Wi-Fi icon,1.0,11.0,27671965.0,31326.0,2014-12-26 21:21:22,<ios><dns>,2015-02-05 18:50:51,-1.0,2178.0

UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST: has_links looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a true method. Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of self , but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named self (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call class.patch(obj) instead of just class.patch() if you want the same functionality as a true method.

810,6371.0,132.0,15175.0,"I've had a hard time trying to find good examples of how to manage database schemas and data between development, test, and production servers. Here's our setup. Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN. We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build. We have a test (virtual) server that runs ""release candidates."" Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server. Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy. If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is ""base"" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables. This is the biggest barrier I see in moving toward continuous integration and one-step-builds. How do you solve it?

I know that this could spill over into a debate regarding 32bit vs 64bit on servers, but let's just say that my preference is 64bit and that I have some has_links has_links reasons. So far, I've tried a number of options and found a has_links of has_links related to getting this up on a 32bit machine (and succeeded I might add), but since the original has_links is Win32 specific, this is hardly going to help when installing as a service on x64. It also has a dependency on the has_links for which I can only get a Win32 compiled version. I suspect that simply loading all this up in C++ and hitting ""compile"" (for 64bit) wouldn't work, not least because of the intricate differences in 32 and 64bit architectures, but I'm wondering if anyone is workng on getting this off the ground?

Of course yes, lots of Win32 code works seamlessly on x64 architecture, hence you can run 32bit apps (like Office for instance) or games on Vista/XP 64 etc, but this doesn't translate directly when it comes to services.

I'm currently using the has_links function imagecopyresampled to take high resolution images, and cleanly resize them down to a size for web viewing (roughly 700 pixels wide by 700 pixels tall).

I also hope that it will prove to be a useful resource for other people wanting to learn about LINQ. What is LINQ? From has_links : The LINQ Project is a codename for a set of extensions to the .NET Framework that encompass language-integrated query, set, and transform operations. It extends C# and Visual Basic with native language syntax for queries and provides class libraries to take advantage of these capabilities. What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax. What flavours of LINQ are there? Currently there are a few different LINQ providers provided by Microsoft: has_links which allows you to execute queries on any IEnumerable object. has_links which allows you to execute queries against a database in an object oriented manner. has_links which allows you to query, load, validate, serialize and manipulate XML documents. has_links as suggested by has_links has_links There are quite a few others, many of which are listed has_links . What are the benefits?

Obviously, each project is unique, so my question here is not so much whether assertions should be kept, but in which cases this is recommendable/not a good idea. By assertion, I mean: A run-time check that tests a condition which, when false, reveals a bug in the software. A mechanism by which the program is halted (maybe after really minimal clean-up work). I'm not necessarily talking about C or C++. My own opinion is that if you're the programmer, but don't own the data (which is the case with most commercial desktop applications), you should keep them on, because a failing asssertion shows a bug, and you should not go on with a bug, with the risk of corrupting the user's data. This forces you to test strongly before you ship, and makes bugs more visible, thus easier to spot and fix. What's your opinion/experience? Cheers, Carl See related question has_links Responses and Updates Hey Graham, An assertion is error, pure and simple and therefore should be handled like one. Since an error should be handled in release mode then you don't really need assertions. That's why I prefer the word ""bug"" when talking about assertions. It makes things much clearer. To me, the word ""error"" is too vague. A missing file is an error, not a bug, and the program should deal with it. Trying to dereference a null pointer is a bug, and the program should acknowledge that something smells like bad cheese. Hence, you should test the pointer with an assertion, but the presence of the file with normal error-handling code. Slight off-topic, but an important point in the discussion. As a heads-up, if your assertions break into the debugger when they fail, why not. But there are plenty of reasons a file could not exist that are completely outside of the control of your code: read/write rights, disk full, USB device unplugged, etc. Since you don't have control over it, I feel assertions are not the right way to deal with that. Carl Thomas, Yes, I have Code Complete, and must say I strongly disagree with that particular advice. Say your custom memory allocator screws up, and zeroes a chunk of memory that is still used by some other object. I happens to zero a pointer that this object dereferences regularly, and one of the invariants is that this pointer is never null, and you have a couple of assertions to make sure it stays that way. What do you do if the pointer suddenly is null. You just if() around it, hoping that it works? Remember, we're talking about product code here, so there's no breaking into the debugger and inspecting the local state. This is a real bug on the user's machine.

840,20047.0,79.0,25834.0,"We're seeing some pernicious, but rare, deadlock conditions in the Stack Overflow SQL Server 2005 database. I attached the profiler, set up a trace profile using has_links , and captured a bunch of examples. The weird thing is that the deadlocking write is always the same : UPDATE [dbo].[Posts] SET [AnswerCount] = @p1, [LastActivityDate] = @p2, [LastActivityUserId] = @p3 WHERE [Id] = @p0 The other deadlocking statement varies, but it's usually some kind of trivial, simple read of the posts table. This one always gets killed in the deadlock. Here's an example SELECT [t0].[Id], [t0].[PostTypeId], [t0].[Score], [t0].[Views], [t0].[AnswerCount], [t0].[AcceptedAnswerId], [t0].[IsLocked], [t0].[IsLockedEdit], [t0].[ParentId], [t0].[CurrentRevisionId], [t0].[FirstRevisionId], [t0].[LockedReason], [t0].[LastActivityDate], [t0].[LastActivityUserId] FROM [dbo].[Posts] AS [t0] WHERE [t0].[ParentId] = @p0 To be perfectly clear, we are not seeing write / write deadlocks, but read / write. We have a mixture of LINQ and parameterized SQL queries at the moment. We have added with (nolock) to all the SQL queries. This may have helped some. We also had a single (very) poorly-written badge query that I fixed yesterday, which was taking upwards of 20 seconds to run every time, and was running every minute on top of that. I was hoping this was the source of some of the locking problems! Unfortunately, I got another deadlock error about 2 hours ago. Same exact symptoms, same exact culprit write. The truly strange thing is that the locking write SQL statement you see above is part of a very specific code path. It's only executed when a new answer is added to a question -- it updates the parent question with the new answer count and last date/user. This is, obviously, not that common relative to the massive number of reads we are doing! As far as I can tell, we're not doing huge numbers of writes anywhere in the app. I realize that NOLOCK is sort of a giant hammer, but most of the queries we run here don't need to be that accurate. Will you care if your user profile is a few seconds out of date? Using NOLOCK with Linq is a bit more difficult as has_links . We are flirting with the idea of using SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED on the base database context so that all our LINQ queries have this set. Without that, we'd have to wrap every LINQ call we make (well, the simple reading ones, which is the vast majority of them) in a 3-4 line transaction code block, which is ugly. I guess I'm a little frustrated that trivial reads in SQL 2005 can deadlock on writes. I could see write/write deadlocks being a huge issue, but reads? We're not running a banking site here, we don't need perfect accuracy every time. Ideas? Thoughts? Are you instantiating a new LINQ to SQL DataContext object for every operation or are you perhaps sharing the same static context for all your calls? Jeremy, we are sharing one static datacontext in the base Controller for the most part: private DBContext _db; /// /// Gets the DataContext to be used by a Request's controllers. /// public DBContext DB { get { if (_db == null) { _db = new DBContext() { SessionName = GetType().Name }; //_db.ExecuteCommand(""SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED""); } return _db; } } Do you recommend we create a new context for every Controller, or per Page, or .. more often?",Diagnosing Deadlocks in SQL Server 2005,23.0,5.0,21158.0,1.0,2008-08-21 14:18:41,<sql-server><sql-server-2005><deadlock>,,1.0,4381.0

I thought it would be fine to just add the XML attributes to all of the classes involved and everything would be peachy. Sadly, thats not the case! So I have done some digging on Google and I now understand why it's not working. In that the XmlSerializer is in fact doing some clever reflection in order to serialize objects to/from XML, and since its based on the abstract type, it cannot figure out what the hell it's talking to .

So my question is: If you are using AJAX on a site, like StackOverflow, are Http-Only cookies an option? Edit 2: Question 2. If the purpose of HttpOnly is to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, and you can still retrieve the cookies via JavaScript through the XmlHttpRequest Object, what is the point of HttpOnly ? Edit 3: Here is a quote from Wikipedia: When the browser receives such a cookie, it is supposed to use it as usual in the following HTTP exchanges, but not to make it visible to client-side scripts.[32] The HttpOnly flag is not part of any standard, and is not implemented in all browsers. Note that there is currently no prevention of reading or writing the session cookie via a XMLHTTPRequest. [33]. I understand that document.cookie is blocked when you use HttpOnly. But it seems that you can still read cookie values in the XMLHttpRequest object, allowing for XSS. How does HttpOnly make you any safer than? By making cookies essentially read only? In your example, I cannot write to your document.cookie , but I can still steal your cookie and post it to my domain using the XMLHttpRequest object. var req = null; try { req = new XMLHttpRequest(); } catch(e) {} if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject(""Msxml2.XMLHTTP""); } catch(e) {} if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP""); } catch(e) {} req.open('GET', 'http://stackoverflow.com/', false); req.send(null); alert(req.getAllResponseHeaders()); Edit 4: Sorry, I meant that you could send the XMLHttpRequest to the StackOverflow domain, and then save the result of getAllResponseHeaders() to a string, regex out the cookie, and then post that to an external domain. It appears that Wikipedia and ha.ckers concur with me on this one, but I would love be re-educated... Final Edit: Ahh, apparently both sites are wrong, this is actually a has_links . IE6 & 7 are actually the only browsers that currently fully support HttpOnly. To reiterate everything I've learned: HttpOnly restricts all access to document.cookie in IE7 & and FireFox (not sure about other browsers) HttpOnly removes cookie information from the response headers in XMLHttpObject.getAllResponseHeaders() in IE7.

Edited for clarity: What is a good algorithm for parsing equations with precedence? I'm interested in something simple to implement and understand that I can code myself to avoid licensing issues with available code.

After a quick research I found has_links and others saying on Windows machine the JVM defaults max heap size as 64MB . Given this situation, how should I deal with this constraint? I could increase the max heap size using command line option to java, but that would require figuring out available RAM and writing some launching program or script. Besides, increasing to some finite max does not ultimately get rid of the issue. I could rewrite some of my code to persist objects to file system frequently (using database is the same thing) to free up the memory. It could work, but it's probably a lot work too. If you could point me to details of above ideas or some alternatives like automatic virtual memory, extending heap size dynamically , that will be great.","How to deal with ""java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space"" error (64MB heap size)",14.0,1.0,37349.0,3827.0,2008-09-01 01:10:03,<java><performance><jvm><out-of-memory><heap>,,1.0,1361.0

893,38239.0,88.0,5872.0,"Background Last year, I did an internship in a physics research group at a university. In this group, we mostly used has_links to write programs for controlling our setups, doing data acquisition and analyzing our data. For the first two purposes, that works quite OK, but for data analysis, it's a real pain. On top of that, everyone was mostly self-taught, so code that was written was generally quite a mess (no wonder that every PhD quickly decided to rewrite everything from scratch). Version control was unknown, and impossible to set up because of strict software and network regulations from the IT department. Now, things actually worked out surprisingly OK, but how do people in the natural sciences do their software development? Questions Some concrete questions: What languages/environments have you used for developing scientific software, especially data analysis? What libraries? (for example, what do you use for plotting?) Was there any training for people without any significant background in programming? Did you have anything like version control, and bug tracking? How would you go about trying to create a decent environment for programming, without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists (especially physicists are stubborn people!) Summary of answers thus far The answers (or my interpretation of them) thus far: (2008-10-11) Languages/packages that seem to be the most widely used: LabVIEW has_links with has_links , has_links , has_links , etc. (See also Brandon's reply for downloads and links) C/C++ has_links Version control is used by nearly all respondents; bug tracking and other processes are much less common. The Software Carpentry course is a good way to teach programming and development techniques to scientists. How to improve things? Don't force people to follow strict protocols. Set up an environment yourself, and show the benefits to others. Help them to start working with version control, bug tracking, etc. themselves.

While it's possible to use goto to produce unmaintainable, sprawling code, it nevertheless remains in has_links . Even the advanced has_links control structure in Scheme can be described as a sophisticated goto. What circumstances warrant the use of goto? When is it best to avoid? As a followup question: C provides a pair of functions, setjmp and longjmp, that provide the ability to goto not just within the current stack frame but within any of the calling frames. Should these be considered as dangerous as goto? More dangerous? Dijkstra himself regretted that title, for which he was not responsible. At the end of has_links (also has_links .pdf) he wrote: Finally a short story for the record. In 1968, the Communications of the ACM published a text of mine under the title "" The goto statement considered harmful "", which in later years would be most frequently referenced, regrettably, however, often by authors who had seen no more of it than its title, which became a cornerstone of my fame by becoming a template: we would see all sorts of articles under the title ""X considered harmful"" for almost any X, including one titled ""Dijkstra considered harmful"". But what had happened? I had submitted a paper under the title "" A case against the goto statement "", which, in order to speed up its publication, the editor had changed into a ""letter to the Editor"", and in the process he had given it a new title of his own invention! The editor was Niklaus Wirth. A well thought out classic paper about this topic, to be matched to that of Dijkstra, is has_links , by Donald E. Knuth. Reading both helps to reestablish context and a non-dogmatic understanding of the subject. In this paper, Dijkstra's opinion on this case is reported and is even more strong: Donald E. Knuth: I believe that by presenting such a view I am not in fact disagreeing sharply with Dijkstra's ideas, since he recently wrote the following: ""Please don't fall into the trap of believing that I am terribly dogmatical about [the go to statement].

Pointers can point nowhere ( NULL ), whereas reference always refer to an object. You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers. There's no ""reference arithmetics"" (but you can take the address of an object pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetics on it as in &obj + 5 ). To clarify a misconception: The C++ standard is very careful to avoid dictating how a compiler must implement references, but every C++ compiler implements references as pointers. That is, a declaration such as: int &ri = i; if it's not optimized away entirely , allocates the same amount of storage as a pointer, and places the address of i into that storage. So, a pointer and a reference both occupy the same amount of memory. As a general rule, Use references in function parameters and return types to define useful and self-documenting interfaces.

Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to include the migrations which insert data, only those which set up tables, keys etc. My question is, what's the best way to handle this situation: Is there a way to get d:s:l to include data-insertion migrations? Should I not be using migrations at all to insert data this way? Should I not be pre-populating the database with data at all? Should I update the application code so that it handles the case where there are no users gracefully, and lets an initial user account be created live from within the application?

I see Singletons as a Design Pattern (good and bad). The problem with Singleton is not the Pattern but rather the users (sorry everybody). Everybody and their father thinks they can implement one correctly (and from the many interviews I have done, most people can't). Also because everybody thinks they can implement a correct Singleton they abuse the Pattern and use it in situations that are not appropriate (replacing global variables with Singletons!). So the main questions that need to be answered are: When should you use a Singleton How do you implement a Singleton correctly My hope for this article is that we can collect together in a single place (rather than having to google and search multiple sites) an authoritative source of when (and then how) to use a Singleton correctly. Also appropriate would be a list of Anti-Usages and common bad implementations explaining why they fail to work and for good implementations their weaknesses.

1023,87372.0,64.0,23597.0,"I'm asking for a template trick to detect if a class has a specific member function of a given signature. The problem is similar to the one cited here has_links but not the same: in the item of Sutter's book he answered to the question that a class C MUST PROVIDE a member function with a particular signature, else the program won't compile. In my problem I need to do something if a class has that function, else do ""something else"". A similar problem was faced by boost::serialization but I don't like the solution they adopted: a template function that invokes by default a free function (that you have to define) with a particular signature unless you define a particular member function (in their case ""serialize"" that takes 2 parameters of a given type) with a particular signature, else a compile error will happens. That is to implement both intrusive and non-intrusive serialization. I don't like that solution for two reasons: 1) to be non intrusive you must override the global ""serialize"" function that is in boost::serialization namespace, so you have IN YOUR CLIENT CODE to open namespace boost and namespace serialization!! And a second, practical reason, is because the stack to resolve that mess was 10 to 12 function invocation... and I'm a game developer. I need to define a custom behavior for classes that has not that member function, and my entities are inside different namespaces (and I don't want to override a global function defined in one namespace while I'm in another one) Can you give me an hint to solve this puzzle? EDIT: @Chris Jester-Young I know well Koenig lookup. In fact I was surprised of what they did in documentation ( has_links ) why open the boost::serialization namespace? but you are not answering to my question: I don't want to do the same thing of boost::serialization. Maybe I decide to do ""nothing"" if the class has not that function with that signature. in boost::serialization if you don't have that member function OR if you don't override global ""serialize"" function... compile error! I don't want this. EDIT: @Tom Leys I'm sorry that's not what I expected as answer. What you suggest me is not what I want. If you read the link to the gotw site (old site of Herb Sutter) you'll discover that your solution is both intrusive (and I don't want) and it doesn't solve the problem with the signature and it doesn't solve the fact that I can accept classes that don't have that member function...

The application won't go idle until the worker is done. (Plus, it's a busy loop - and how disgusting is that) Others have add suggested kludging it into: while (!_worker.IsDone) { Application.DoEvents(); } Problem with that is that is Application.DoEvents() causes messages currently in the queue to be processed, which cause re-entrantcy problems (.NET isn't re-entrant). i would hope to use some solution involving Event synchronization objects, where the code waits for an event - that the worker's RunWorkerCompleted event handlers sets.

This makes unit-testing the business logic fairly straightforward; things can be implemented in discrete modules and any data needed for the test can be faked through object mocking. But testing the ORM and database itself has always been fraught with problems and compromises. Over the years, I have tried a few strategies, none of which completely satisfied me. Load a test database with known data. Run tests against the ORM and confirm that the right data comes back. The disadvantage here is that your test DB has to keep up with any schema changes in the application database, and might get out of sync. It also relies on artificial data, and may not expose bugs that occur due to stupid user input. Finally, if the test database is small, it won't reveal inefficiencies like a missing index. (OK, that last one isn't really what unit testing should be used for, but it doesn't hurt.) Load a copy of the production database and test against that. The problem here is that you may have no idea what's in the production DB at any given time; your tests may need to be rewritten if data changes over time. Some people have pointed out that both of these strategies rely on specific data, and a unit test should test only functionality. To that end, I've seen suggested: Use a mock database server, and check only that the ORM is sending the correct queries in response to a given method call.

1169,149380.0,94.0,41661.0,"This is an issue that I've spent hours researching in the past. It seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern has_links solutions but as yet I have not found anything that really addresses what I see to be an incredibly common need in any Web or Windows application with a database back-end. I speak of dynamic sorting. In my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like: ORDER BY @sortCol1, @sortCol2 This is the canonical example given by newbie SQL and has_links developers all over forums across the Internet. ""Why isn't this possible?"" they ask. Invariably, somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an ORDER BY clause. I know what some of you are already thinking: ""Let the client do the sorting, then."" Naturally, this offloads the work from your database. In our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months. For this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem. Additionally, databases are very good at sorting. They are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner SQL writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc. When your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice. Then there's the web issue. I've played around with JavaScript that will do client-side sorting of HTML tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really really easily, I have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own JavaScript sorter. The same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over JavaScript. I'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of DataSets, so sue me. But this brings back the point that it isn't possible — or rather, not easily. I've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting. It wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner SQL writer would be lost within seconds. Already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication."" The following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a T-SQL programmer. They are what they are and I fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack. We pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables. For example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default): DECLARE @sortCol1 AS varchar(20) DECLARE @sortCol2 AS varchar(20) DECLARE @dir1 AS varchar(20) DECLARE @dir2 AS varchar(20) DECLARE @col1 AS varchar(20) DECLARE @col2 AS varchar(20) SET @col1 = 'storagedatetime'; SET @col2 = 'vehicleid'; IF @sort = 1 -- Default sort. BEGIN SET @sortCol1 = @col1; SET @dir1 = 'asc'; SET @sortCol2 = @col2; SET @dir2 = 'asc'; END ELSE IF @sort = 2 -- Reversed order default sort. BEGIN SET @sortCol1 = @col1; SET @dir1 = 'desc'; SET @sortCol2 = @col2; SET @dir2 = 'desc'; END You can already see how if I declared more @colX variables to define other columns I could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause: ORDER BY CASE @dir1 WHEN 'desc' THEN CASE @sortCol1 WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime] WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid] END END DESC, CASE @dir1 WHEN 'asc' THEN CASE @sortCol1 WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime] WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid] END END, CASE @dir2 WHEN 'desc' THEN CASE @sortCol2 WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime] WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid] END END DESC, CASE @dir2 WHEN 'asc' THEN CASE @sortCol2 WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime] WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid] END END Obviously this is a very stripped down example. The real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases. Yeah... it gets hairy really quick. The idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there. Essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a NULL value. And thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following: ORDER BY NULL DESC, NULL, [storagedatetime] DESC, blah blah You get the idea. It works because SQL Server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses. This is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of SQL can probably see. If I've lost any of you, don't feel bad. It took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it. Thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble."" Yet it did work. My question is then: is there a better way? I'm okay with solutions other than Stored Procedure ones, as I realize it may just not be the way to go. Preferably, I'd like to know if anyone can do it better within the Stored Procedure, but if not, how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data (bi-directionally, too) with ASP.NET? And thank you for reading (or at least skimming) such a long question! PS: Be glad I didn't show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting, dynamic filtering/text-searching of columns, pagination via ROWNUMBER() OVER, AND try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors... ""behemoth-sized"" doesn't even begin to describe them. Update: I would like to avoid dynamic SQL . Parsing a string together and running an EXEC on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place. Sometimes I wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldn't be worth it, at least in these special dynamic sorting cases. Still, I always feel dirty whenever I do dynamic SQL strings like that — like I'm still living in the Classic ASP world. A lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for security . I don't get to make the call on security concerns, only suggest solutions. With SQL Server 2005 we can set permissions (on a per-user basis if need be) at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly. Critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for another question, but again it's not my decision.

This seems to be the case regardless of whether one uses the pre-NIO Socket or the NIO SocketChannel . When a peer gracefully closes a TCP connection, the TCP stacks on both sides of the connection know about the fact. The server-side (the one that initiates the shutdown) ends up in state FIN_WAIT2 , whereas the client-side (the one that does not explicitly respond to the shutdown) ends up in state CLOSE_WAIT . Why isn't there a method in Socket or SocketChannel that can query the TCP stack to see whether the underlying TCP connection has been terminated? Is it that the TCP stack doesn't provide such status information? Or is it a design decision to avoid a costly call into the kernel? With the help of the users who have already posted some answers to this question, I think I see where the issue might be coming from. The side that doesn't explicitly close the connection ends up in TCP state CLOSE_WAIT meaning that the connection is in the process of shutting down and waits for the side to issue its own CLOSE operation.

1214,173670.0,60.0,6200.0,"Being primarily a C++ developer the absence of has_links in Java and .NET has always bothered me. The fact that the onus of cleaning up is moved from the class writer to its consumer (by means of try finally or .NET's has_links ) seems to be markedly inferior. I see why in Java there is no support for RAII since all objects are located on the heap and the garbage collector inherently doesn't support deterministic destruction, but in .NET with the introduction of value-types ( struct ) we have the (seemingly) perfect candidate for RAII. A value type that's created on the stack has a well defined scope and C++ destructor semantics can be used. However the CLR does not permit a value-type to have a destructor. My random searches found one argument that if a value-type is has_links it falls under the jurisdiction of the garbage collector and therefore its destruction becomes non-deterministic. I feel that this argument isn't strong enough, the benefits of RAII are big enough to say that a value-type with a destructor cannot be boxed (or used as a class member). To cut a long story short my question is : are there any other reasons value types can not be used in order to introduce RAII to .NET? (or do you think my argument about RAII's obvious advantages are flawed?) Edit: I must have not phrased the question clearly since the first four answers have missed the point. I know about Finalize and its non-deterministic characteristics, I know about the using construct and I feel these two options are inferior to RAII. using is one more thing the consumer of a class must remember (how many people forgot to put a StreamReader in a using block?). My question is a philosophical one about the language design, why is it the way it is and can it be improved? For instance with a generic deterministically destructible value-type I can make the using and lock keywords redundant (achievable by library classes): public struct Disposer where T : IDisposable { T val; public Disposer(T t) { val = t; } public T Value { get { return val; } } ~Disposer() // Currently illegal { if (val != default(T)) val.Dispose(); } } I can't help but end with a apropos quotation which I once saw but can't currently find its origin.

1246,187761.0,122.0,75066.0,"POSIX allows mutexes to be recursive. That means the same thread can lock the same mutex twice and won't deadlock. Of course it also needs to unlock it twice, otherwise no other thread can obtain the mutex. Not all systems supporting pthreads also support recursive mutexes, but if they want to be has_links . Other APIs (more high level APIs) also usually offer mutexes, often called Locks. Some systems/languages (e.g. Cocoa Objective-C) offer both, recursive and non recursive mutexes. Some languages also only offer one or the other one. E.g. in Java mutexes are always recursive (the same thread may twice ""synchronize"" on the same object). Depending on what other thread functionality they offer, not having recursive mutexes might be no problem, as they can easily be written yourself (I already implemented recursive mutexes myself on the basis of more simple mutex/condition operations). What I don't really understand: What are non-recursive mutexes good for? Why would I want to have a thread deadlock if it locks the same mutex twice? Even high level languages that could avoid that (e.g. testing if this will deadlock and throwing an exception if it does) usually don't do that. They will let the thread deadlock instead.

Now, before starting some bigger project, the discussion arose how to design data access and whether or not to use an ORM layer. As I am still in my apprenticeship and still consider myself a beginner in enterprise programming, I did not really try to push in my opinion, which is that using an object relational mapper to the database can ease development quite a lot. The other coders in the development team are much more experienced than me, so I think I will just do what they say. :-) However, I do not completely understand two of the main reasons for not using NHibernate or a similar project: One can just build one’s own data access objects with SQL queries and copy those queries out of Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Debugging an ORM can be hard. So, of course I could just build my data access layer with a lot of SELECT s etc, but here I miss the advantage of automatic joins, lazy-loading proxy classes and a lower maintenance effort if a table gets a new column or a column gets renamed. (Updating numerous SELECT , INSERT and UPDATE queries vs. updating the mapping config and possibly refactoring the business classes and DTOs.) Also, using NHibernate you can run into unforeseen problems if you do not know the framework very well. That could be, for example, trusting the Table.hbm.xml where you set a string’s length to be automatically validated. However, I can also imagine similar bugs in a “simple” SqlConnection query based data access layer. Finally, are those arguments mentioned above really a good reason not to utilise an ORM for a non-trivial database based enterprise application? Are there probably other arguments they/I might have missed? (I should probably add that I think this is like the first “big” .NET/C# based application which will require teamwork.

It's so useful!"" [Disclaimer: These tips work in VS 2005 on a C# project, no guarantees for older incarnations of VS or other languages] Keep track of object instances Working with multiple instances of a given class? How can you tell them apart? In pre-garbage collection programming days, it was easy to keep track of references - just look at the memory address. With .NET, you can't do that - objects can get moved around. Fortunately, the watches view lets you right-click on a watch and select 'Make Object ID'. This appends a {1#}, {2#} etc. after the instance's value, effectively giving the instance a unique label. It looks like this: The label is persisted for the lifetime of that object. Meaningful values for watched variables By default, a watched variable's value is it's type. If you want to see its fields, you have to expand it, and this could take a long time (or even timeout!) if there are many fields or they do something complicated. However, some predefined types show more meaningful information : strings show their actual contents lists and dictionaries show their elements count etc. Wouldn't it be nice to have that for my own types? Hmm... ...some quality time with .NET Reflector shows how easily this can be accomplished with the DebuggerDisplay attribute on my custom type: [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerDisplay(""Employee: '{Name}'"")] public class Employee { public string Name { get { ... } } ... } ... re-run, and...

This would be similar to ValidationGroups with standard ASP.NET validator controls. My situation: It's with ASP.NET WebForms, but you can ignore that if you wish.

At that point in the error container there's another submit button now visible that can be pressed which would ignore the validation and submit anyways. How to circumvent the forms .validate() for this button control and still post? The Buy and Sell a House sample at has_links allows for this in order to hit the previous links, but it does so through creating custom methods and adding it to the validator.

Referenced in each project with svn:externals*/ \NUnit.v2.4.8 \NCover.v.1.5.8 \ \commonFiles /*settings strong name keys etc.*/ \ReSharper.settings \VisualStudio.settings \thrash /*each member of the team has thrash for samples, experiments etc*/ \user1 \user2 \projects \Solution1 /*Single actual project (Visual Studio Solution)*/ \trunk \src \Project1 /*Each sub-project resulting in single .dll or .exe*/ \Project2 \lib \tools \tests \Solution1.sln \tags \branches \Solution2 \trunk \src \Project3 /*Each sub-project resulting in single .dll or .exe*/ \Project1 /*Project1 from Solution1 references with svn:externals*/ \lib \tools \tests \Solution2.sln \tags \branches To clear the vocabulary: Solution means single product, Project is a Visual Studio Project (that results in a single .dll or single .exe) That's how we plan to lay out the repository. The main issue is, that we have multiple Solutions, but we want to share Projects among Solutions. We thought that there is no point really in moving those shared Projects to their own Solutions, and instead we decided to use svn:externals to share Projects among Solutions. We also want to keep common set of tools and 3rd party libraries in one place in the repository, and them reference them in each Solution with svn:externals. What do you think about this layout? Especially about the use of svn:externals. It's not an ideal solution, but considering all pros and cons, it's the best we could think of.

Summary (label changed from original to make intent even clearer): infinite_loop: // code goes here goto infinite_loop; Why it's better than the alternatives: It's specific. goto is the language construct which causes an unconditional branch. Alternatives depend on using structures supporting conditional branches, with a degenerate always-true condition. The label documents the intent without extra comments. The reader doesn't have to scan the intervening code for early break s (although it's still possible for an unprincipled hacker to simulate continue with an early goto ). Rules: Pretend that the gotophobes didn't win. It's understood that the above can't be used in real code because it goes against established idiom. Assume that we have all heard of 'Goto considered harmful' and know that goto can be used to write spaghetti code. If you disagree with an example, criticize it on technical merit alone ('Because people don't like goto' is not a technical reason). Let's see if we can talk about this like grown ups. Edit This question seems finished now. It generated some high quality answers. Thanks to everyone, especially those who took my little loop example seriously. Most skeptics were concerned by the lack of block scope. As @quinmars pointed out in a comment, you can always put braces around the loop body. I note in passing that for(;;) and while(true) don't give you the braces for free either (and omitting them can cause vexing bugs). Anyway, I won't waste any more of your brain power on this trifle - I can live with the harmless and idiomatic for(;;) and while(true) (just as well if I want to keep my job). Considering the other responses, I see that many people view goto as something you always have to rewrite in another way. Of course you can avoid a goto by introducing a loop, an extra flag, a stack of nested if s, or whatever, but why not consider whether goto is perhaps the best tool for the job? Put another way, how much ugliness are people prepared to endure to avoid using a built-in language feature for its intended purpose? My take is that even adding a flag is too high a price to pay. I like my variables to represent things in the problem or solution domains. 'Solely to avoid a goto ' doesn't cut it.

The has_links section of the has_links does have an example on how to override isEqual: , copied as follows, for a class named MyWidget : - (BOOL)isEqual:(id)other { if (other == self) return YES; if (!other || ![other isKindOfClass:[self class]]) return NO; return [self isEqualToWidget:other]; } - (BOOL)isEqualToWidget:(MyWidget *)aWidget { if (self == aWidget) return YES; if (![(id)[self name] isEqual:[aWidget name]]) return NO; if (![[self data] isEqualToData:[aWidget data]]) return NO; return YES; } It checks pointer equality, then class equality, and finally compares the objects using isEqualToWidget: , which only checks the name and data properties. What the example doesn't show is how to override hash . Let's assume there are other properties that do not affect equality, say age . Shouldn't the hash method be overridden such that only name and data affect the hash? And if so, how would you do that? Just add the hashes of name and data ?

From my investigations, I know some of the things involved: In our .csproj files, there are these settings: Sometimes they are all set to ""SAK"", sometimes not. It seems things are more likely to work if these say ""SAK"". In our .sln file, there are settings for many of the projects: SccLocalPath# SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection# SccProjectUniqueName# (The # is a number that identifies each project.) SccLocalPath is a path relative to the solution file. Often it is ""."", sometimes it is the folder that the project is in, and sometimes it is "".."" or ""..\.."", and it seems to be bad for it to point to a folder above the solution folder. The relativized one is a path from that folder to the project file. It will be missing entirely if SccLocalPath points to the project's folder. If the SccLocalPath has "".."" in it, this path might include folder names that are not the same between branches, which I think causes problems.

What do you use as the default initializer and why? Edit: Based on the answers I futher my further thoughts Avoiding error handling If the value shouldn't be null, why did it get set to NULL in the first place? Perhaps it would be better to identify the error at the place where it occurs rather than cover it up through out the rest of your codebase? Avoiding null checks If you are tired of doing null checks in code, wouldn't it be better to abstract the null checks? Perhaps wrap (or extend!) the string methods to make them NULL safe? What happens if you constantly use String.Empty and a null happens to work it's way into your system, do you start adding NULL checks anyways? I can't help but return to the opinion that it is laziness. Any DBA would slap you nine ways to silly if you used '' instead of null in his\her database.

You just have to hate it, and it has to be your favorite language. Don't compare it to another language, and don't talk about languages that you already hate. Don't talk about the things you like in your favorite language. I just want to hear the things that you hate but tolerate so you can use all of the other stuff, and I want to hear it about the language you wished other people would use. I ask this whenever someone tries to push their favorite language on me, and sometimes as an interview question. If someone can't find five things to hate about his favorite tool, he doesn't know it well enough to either advocate it or pull in the big dollars using it. He hasn't used it in enough different situations to fully explore it. He's advocating it as a culture or religion, which means that if I don't choose his favorite technology, I'm wrong. I don't care that much which language you use. Don't want to use a particular language? Then don't. You go through due diligence to make an informed choice and still don't use it? Fine.

1430,286846.0,107.0,43278.0,"Let's share Java based web application architectures! There are lots of different architectures for web applications which are to be implemented using Java. The answers to this question may serve as a library of various web application designs with their pros and cons. While I realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list. Use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, when should we use your architecture? I'll start... Overview of the architecture We use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages. Persistence Business Presentation The possible communication flows between the layers are represented by: Persistence <-> Business <-> Presentation Which for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. This architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application. Persistence Performs create, read, update and delete ( has_links ) persistence operations. In our case we are using ( has_links ) JPA and we currently use has_links as our persistence provider and use has_links . This layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities (i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class) and is used by one and only one manager . In addition this layer also stores has_links which are things like Account , ShoppingCart etc. Business All logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. This functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product on-line using her/his credit card. It could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game. This layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with @Stateless to become a has_links (SLSB). Each SLSB is called a manager and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called AccountManager . When AccountManager needs to perform CRUD operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of AccountManagerPersistence , which is a class in the persistence layer. A rough sketch of two methods in AccountManager could be: ... public void makeExpiredAccountsInactive() { AccountManagerPersistence amp = new AccountManagerPersistence(...) // Calls persistence layer List expiredAccounts = amp.getAllExpiredAccounts(); for(Account account : expiredAccounts) { this.makeAccountInactive(account) } } public void makeAccountInactive(Account account) { AccountManagerPersistence amp = new AccountManagerPersistence(...) account.deactivate(); amp.storeUpdatedAccount(account); // Calls persistence layer } We use has_links so we don't have to do transaction demarcation our self's. What basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the SLSB method and commit it (or rollback it) immediately before exiting the method. It's an example of convention over configuration, but we haven't had a need for anything but the default, Required, yet. Here is how The Java EE 5 Tutorial from Sun explains the has_links for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB's): If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean’s method, the method executes within the client’s transaction. If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container starts a new transaction before running the method. The Required attribute is the implicit transaction attribute for all enterprise bean methods running with container-managed transaction demarcation. You typically do not set the Required attribute unless you need to override another transaction attribute. Because transaction attributes are declarative, you can easily change them later. Presentation Our presentation layer is in charge of... presentation! It's responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building HTML pages and receiving user input through GET and POST requests. We are currently using the old has_links 's + Java Server Pages ( has_links ) combination. The layer calls methods in managers of the business layer to perform operations requested by the user and to receive information to show in the web page. Sometimes the information received from the business layer are less complex types as String 's and int egers, and at other times has_links . Pros and cons with the architecture Pros Having everything related to a specific way of doing persistence in this layer only means we can swap from using JPA into something else, without having to re-write anything in the business layer. It's easy for us to swap our presentation layer into something else, and it's likely that we will if we find something better. Letting the EJB container manage transaction boundaries is nice. Using Servlet's + JPA is easy (to begin with) and the technologies are widely used and implemented in lots of servers. Using Java EE is supposed to make it easier for us to create a high availability system with has_links and has_links . Both of which we feel that we must have. Cons Using JPA you may store often used queries as named queries by using the @NamedQuery annotation on the JPA entity class. If you have as much as possible related to persistence in the persistence classes, as in our architecture, this will spread out the locations where you may find queries to include the JPA entities as well. It will be harder to overview persistence operations and thus harder to maintain. We have JPA entities as part of our persistence layer. But Account and ShoppingCart , aren't they really business objects? It is done this way as you have to touch these classes and turn them into entities which JPA knows how to handle. The JPA entities, which are also our business objects, are created like Data Transfer Objects ( has_links 's), also known as Value Objects (VO's). This results in an has_links as the business objects have no logic of their own except accessor methods. All logic is done by our managers in the business layer, which results in a more procedural programming style. It's not good object oriented design, but maybe that's not a problem? (After all object orientation isn't the only programming paradigm which has delivered results.) Using EJB and Java EE introduces a bit of complexity. And we can't use purely Tomcat (adding an EJB micro-container isn't purely Tomcat). There are lots of issues with using Servlet's + JPA. Use Google for more information about these issues. As the transactions are closed when exiting the business layer we can't load any information from JPA entities which is configured to be loaded from the database when it's needed (using fetch=FetchType.LAZY ) from inside the presentation layer. It will trigger an exception. Before returning an entity containing these kinds of fields we have to be sure to call the relevant getter's. Another option is to use Java Persistence Query Language ( has_links ) and do a FETCH JOIN . However both of these options are a little bit cumbersome.",Describe the architecture you use for Java web applications?,10.0,3.0,286893.0,,2008-11-13 12:55:32,<java><architecture><java-ee>,2015-10-05 08:30:06,1.0,9754.0

Well, when a new release of Java is done it is simultaneously available on all platforms it supports, on the other hand how many features of C# 3.0 are still missing in the Mono implementation? Or is it really has_links vs. has_links that we should compare here? Java doesn't support events and delegates. As far as I know.

1445,295579.0,788.0,149918.0,"I'm looking for the fastest way to determine if a long value is a perfect square (i.e. its square root is another integer). I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in Math.sqrt() function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by restricting yourself to integer-only domain. Maintaining a lookup table is impratical (since there are about 2 31.5 integers whose square is less than 2 63 ). Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now: public final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n) { if (n < 0) return false; long tst = (long)(Math.sqrt(n) + 0.5); return tst*tst == n; } Notes: I'm using this function in many has_links problems. So no one else will ever have to maintain this code. And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems. Update 2 : A new solution posted by has_links has proven to be even faster. In a run over the first 1 billion integers, the solution only required 34% of the time that the original solution used. While the John Carmack hack is a little better for small values of n , the benefit compared to this solution is pretty small. Here is the A. Rex solution, converted to Java: private final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n) { // Quickfail if( n < 0 || ((n&2) != 0) || ((n & 7) == 5) || ((n & 11) == 8) ) return false; if( n == 0 ) return true;

Update : I've tried the different solutions presented below. After exhaustive testing, I found that adding 0.5 to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine. The has_links was faster, but it gave incorrect results starting at n=410881. However, as suggested by has_links , we can use the Carmack hack for n < 410881. Newton's method was a good bit slower than Math.sqrt() . This is probably because Math.sqrt() uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java. Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles. A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than Math.sqrt() . Binary chop was even slower. This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number. The one suggestion which did show improvements was made by has_links . You can observe that the last hex digit (i.e. the last 4 bits) of a perfect square must be 0, 1, 4, or 9. This means that 75% of numbers can be immediately eliminated as possible squares. Implementing this solution resulted in about a 50% reduction in runtime. Working from John's suggestion, I investigated properties of the last n bits of a perfect square. By analyzing the last 6 bits, I found that only 12 out of 64 values are possible for the last 6 bits. This means 81% of values can be eliminated without using any math. Implementing this solution gave an additional 8% reduction in runtime (compared to my original algorithm). Analyzing more than 6 bits results in a list of possible ending bits which is too large to be practical. Here is the code that I have used, which runs in 42% of the time required by the original algorithm (based on a run over the first 100 million integers). For values of n less than 410881, it runs in only 29% of the time required by the original algorithm. private final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n) { if (n < 0) return false; switch((int)(n & 0x3F)) { case 0x00: case 0x01: case 0x04: case 0x09: case 0x10: case 0x11: case 0x19: case 0x21: case 0x24: case 0x29: case 0x31: case 0x39: long sqrt; if(n < 410881L) { //John Carmack hack, converted to Java. // See: http://www.codemaestro.com/reviews/9 int i; float x2, y; x2 = n * 0.5F; y = n; i = Float.floatToRawIntBits(y); i = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 ); y = Float.intBitsToFloat(i); y = y * ( 1.5F - ( x2 * y * y ) ); sqrt = (long)(1.0F/y); } else { //Carmack hack gives incorrect answer for n >= 410881. sqrt = (long)Math.sqrt(n); } return sqrt*sqrt == n; default: return false; } } Notes : According to John's tests, using or statements is faster in C++ than using a switch , but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between or and switch . I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values). Then instead of either switch or or statement, I would just say if(lookup[(int)(n&0x3F)]) { test } else return false; . To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower. I'm not sure why.

1452,299068.0,294.0,37776.0,"Question: Is exception handling in Java actually slow? Conventional wisdom, as well as a lot of Google results, says that exceptional logic shouldn't be used for normal program flow in Java. Two reasons are usually given, its really slow - even an order of magnitude slower than regular code (the reasons given vary), and its messy because people expect only errors to be handled in exceptional code. This question is about #1. As an example, has_links describes Java exception handling as ""very slow"" and relates the slowness to the creation of the exception message string - ""this string is then used in creating the exception object that is thrown. This is not fast."" The article has_links says that ""the reason for this is due to the object creation aspect of exception handling, which thereby makes throwing exceptions inherently slow"". Another reason out there is that the stack trace generation is what slows it down. My testing (using Java 1.6.0_07, Java HotSpot 10.0, on 32 bit Linux), indicates that exception handling is no slower than regular code. I tried running a method in a loop that executes some code. At the end of the method, I use a boolean to indicate whether to return or throw . This way the actual processing is the same. I tried running the methods in different orders and averaging my test times, thinking it may have been the JVM warming up. In all my tests, the throw was at least as fast as the return, if not faster (up to 3.1% faster). I am completely open to the possibility that my tests were wrong, but I haven't seen anything out there in the way of code sample, test comparisons, or results in the last year or two that show exception handling in Java to actually be slow. What lead me down this path was an API I needed to use that threw exceptions as part of normal control logic. I wanted to correct them in their usage, but now I may not be able to. Will I instead have to praise them on their forward thinking? In the paper has_links , the authors suggest that the presence of exception handlers alone, even if no exceptions are thrown, is enough to prevent the JIT compiler from optimizing the code properly, thus slowing it down. I haven't tested this theory yet.",How slow are Java exceptions?,17.0,9.0,299315.0,69572.0,2008-11-18 15:31:11,<java><performance><exception-handling>,,1.0,2760.0

However, it's still of general interest, IMO.) My has_links uses github for its source control, and I'm beginning to really enjoy using git. However, as far as I can tell, github doesn't provide any project management tools: defect and feature tracking, discussions, feature requests, docs etc. Given my affiliations, has_links would be a natural choice, but it would seem odd to create a project there but host the source on github. has_links seems to mostly focus on the defect tracking.

1500,326429.0,65.0,10812.0,"I teach the third required intro course in a CS department. One of my homework assignments asks students to speed up code they have written for a previous assignment. Factor-of-ten speedups are routine; factors of 100 or 1000 are not unheard of. (For a factor of 1000 speedup you have to have made rookie mistakes with malloc().) Programs are improved by a sequence is small changes. I ask students to record and describe each change and the resulting improvement. While you're improving a program it is also possible to break it. Wouldn't it be nice to back out? You can see where I'm going with this: my students would benefit enormously from version control. But there are some caveats: Our computing environment is locked down. Anything that depends on a central repository is suspect. Our students are incredibly overloaded. Not just classes but jobs, sports, music, you name it. For them to use a new tool it has to be incredibly easy and have obvious benefits. Our students do most work in pairs. Getting bits back and forth between accounts is problematic. Could this problem also be solved by distributed version control? Complexity is the enemy. I know setting up a CVS repository is too baffling---I myself still have trouble because I only do it once a year. I'm told SVN is even harder. Here are my comments on existing systems: I think central version control (CVS or SVN) is ruled out because our students don't have the administrative privileges needed to make a repository that they can share with one other student. (We are stuck with Unix file permissions.) Also, setup on CVS or SVN is too hard. darcs is way easy to set up, but it's not obvious how you share things. darcs send (to send patches by email) seems promising but it's not clear how to set it up. The introductory documentation for git is not for beginners. Like CVS setup, it's something I myself have trouble with. I'm soliciting suggestions for what source-control to use with beginning students. I suspect we can find resources to put a thin veneer over an existing system and to simplify existing documentation. We probably don't have resources to write new documentation. So, what's really easy to setup , commit , revert , and share changes with a partner but does not have to be easy to merge or to work at scale?

Query Active Directory with Impersonation A lot of people suggest querying the Active Directory for something. If an exception is thrown, then you know the credentials are not valid - as is suggested in has_links . There are some serious has_links however: You are not only authenticating a domain account, but you are also doing an implicit authorization check. That is, you are reading properties from the AD using an impersonation token. What if the otherwise valid account has no rights to read from the AD? By default all users have read access, but domain policies can be set to disable access permissions for restricted accounts (and or groups). Binding against the AD has a serious overhead, the AD schema cache has to be loaded at the client (ADSI cache in the ADSI provider used by DirectoryServices). This is both network, and AD server, resource consuming - and is too expensive for a simple operation like authenticating a user account. You're relying on an exception failure for a non-exceptional case, and assuming that means invalid username and password. Other problems (e.g. network failure, AD connectivity failure, memory allocation error, etc) are then mis-intrepreted as authentication failure. Method 2. LogonUser Win32 API has_links have suggested using the has_links API function. This sounds nice, but unfortunately the calling user sometimes needs a permission usually only given to the operating system itself: The process calling LogonUser requires the SE_TCB_NAME privilege. If the calling process does not have this privilege, LogonUser fails and GetLastError returns ERROR_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD. In some cases, the process that calls LogonUser must also have the SE_CHANGE_NOTIFY_NAME privilege enabled; otherwise, LogonUser fails and GetLastError returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED. This privilege is not required for the local system account or accounts that are members of the administrators group. By default, SE_CHANGE_NOTIFY_NAME is enabled for all users, but some administrators may disable it for everyone. Handing out the "" Act as a part of the operating system "" privilege is not something you want to do willy-nilly - as Microsoft points out in a has_links : ...the process that is calling LogonUser must have the SE_TCB_NAME privilege (in User Manager, this is the "" Act as part of the Operating System "" right). The SE_TCB_NAME privilege is very powerful and should not be granted to any arbitrary user just so that they can run an application that needs to validate credentials. Additionally, a call to LogonUser() will fail if a blank password is specified. What is the proper way to authenticate a set of domain credentials?

One article I found has_links : Most people I've met have read the Design Patterns book by the Gang of Four. Any self respecting programmer will tell you that the book is language agnostic and the patterns apply to software engineering in general, regardless of which language you use. This is a noble claim. Unfortunately it is far removed from the truth. Functional languages are extremely expressive. In a functional language one does not need design patterns because the language is likely so high level, you end up programming in concepts that eliminate design patterns all together. The main features of functional programming include functions as first-class values, currying, immutable values, etc. It doesn't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features. Additionally, in functional languages which support OOP (such as F# and OCaml), it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language. In fact, right now I use F# and OCaml everyday, and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs the patterns I use when I write in Java.

Like others, I've had some significant trouble apply many of these concepts to my professional work. For me, the primary reason for this is I see a conflict between between FP's goal of remaining stateless seems quite at odds with that fact that most web development work I've done has been heavily tied to databases, which are very data-centric. One thing that made me a much more productive developer on the OOP side of things was the discovery of object-relational mappers like MyGeneration d00dads for .Net, Class::DBI for perl, ActiveRecord for ruby, etc. This allowed me to stay away from writing insert and select statements all day, and to focus on working with the data easily as objects. Of course, I could still write SQL queries when their power was needed, but otherwise it was abstracted nicely behind the scenes. Now, turning to functional-programming, it seems like with many of the FP web frameworks like Links require writing a lot of boilerplate sql code, as in has_links . Weblocks seems a little better, but it seems to use kind of an OOP model for working with data, and still requires code to be manually written for each table in your database as in has_links . I suppose you use some code generation to write these mapping functions, but that seems decidedly un-lisp-like. (Note I have not looked at Weblocks or Links extremely closely, I may just be misunderstanding how they are used). So the question is, for the database access portions (which I believe are pretty large) of web application, or other development requiring interface with a sql database we seem to be forced down one of the following paths: Don't Use Functional Programming Access Data in an annoying, un-abstracted way that involves manually writing a lot of SQL or SQL-like code ala Links Force our functional Language into a pseudo-OOP paradigm, thus removing some of the elegance and stability of true functional programming. Clearly, none of these options seem ideal. Has found a way circumvent these issues? Is there really an even an issue here?

Consider the following example: Say class A has a method, empty(Box b) . We compile A.java and get the class file A.class. Now we create another class B which invokes the method empty with a non-parameterized argument (raw type)- empty(new Box()) . If we compile B.java with A.class in the classpath, javac is smart enough to raise a warning. So A.class has some type information stored in it. My guess would be that type erasure occurs when the class is loaded, but it is just a guess.

1536,345838.0,212.0,112531.0,"With the help of the Stack Overflow community I've written a pretty basic-but fun physics simulator. You click and drag the mouse to launch a ball. It will bounce around and eventually stop on the ""floor"". My next big feature I want to add in is ball to ball collision. The ball's movement is broken up into a x and y speed vector. I have gravity (small reduction of the y vector each step), I have friction (small reduction of both vectors each collision with a wall). The balls honestly move around in a surprisingly realistic way. I guess my question has two parts: What is the best method to detect ball to ball collision? Do I just have an O(n^2) loop that iterates over each ball and checks every other ball to see if it's radius overlaps? What equations do I use to handle the ball to ball collisions? Physics 101 How does it effect the two balls speed x/y vectors? What is the resulting direction the two balls head off in? How do I apply this to each ball? Handling the collision detection of the ""walls"" and the resulting vector changes were easy but I see more complications with ball-ball collisions. With walls I simply had to take the negative of the appropriate x or y vector and off it would go in the correct direction. With balls I don't think it is that way. Some quick clarifications: for simplicity I'm ok with a perfectly elastic collision for now, also all my balls have the same mass right now, but I might change that in the future. In case anyone is interested in playing with the simulator I have made so far, I've uploaded the source has_links (EDIT: Check the updated source below). Edit: Resources I have found useful 2d Ball physics with vectors: has_links 2d Ball collision detection example: has_links Success! I have the ball collision detection and response working great! Relevant code: Collision Detection: for (int i = 0; i < ballCount; i++) { for (int j = i + 1; j < ballCount; j++) { if (balls[i].colliding(balls[j])) { balls[i].resolveCollision(balls[j]); } } } This will check for collisions between every ball but skip redundant checks (if you have to check if ball 1 collides with ball 2 then you don't need to check if ball 2 collides with ball 1. Also, it skips checking for collisions with itself). Then, in my ball class I have my colliding() and resolveCollision() methods: public boolean colliding(Ball ball) { float xd = position.getX() - ball.position.getX(); float yd = position.getY() - ball.position.getY(); float sumRadius = getRadius() + ball.getRadius(); float sqrRadius = sumRadius * sumRadius; float distSqr = (xd * xd) + (yd * yd); if (distSqr <= sqrRadius) { return true; } return false; } public void resolveCollision(Ball ball) { // get the mtd Vector2d delta = (position.subtract(ball.position)); float d = delta.getLength(); // minimum translation distance to push balls apart after intersecting Vector2d mtd = delta.multiply(((getRadius() + ball.getRadius())-d)/d); // resolve intersection -- // inverse mass quantities float im1 = 1 / getMass(); float im2 = 1 / ball.getMass(); // push-pull them apart based off their mass position = position.add(mtd.multiply(im1 / (im1 + im2))); ball.position = ball.position.subtract(mtd.multiply(im2 / (im1 + im2))); // impact speed Vector2d v = (this.velocity.subtract(ball.velocity)); float vn = v.dot(mtd.normalize()); // sphere intersecting but moving away from each other already if (vn > 0.0f) return; // collision impulse float i = (-(1.0f + Constants.restitution) * vn) / (im1 + im2); Vector2d impulse = mtd.multiply(i); // change in momentum this.velocity = this.velocity.add(impulse.multiply(im1)); ball.velocity = ball.velocity.subtract(impulse.multiply(im2)); } Source Code: has_links Binary: has_links If anyone has some suggestions for how to improve this basic physics simulator let me know!

1547,354883.0,336.0,353612.0,"The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is often has_links . Option: Using a tuple Consider this trivial example: def f(x): y0 = x + 1 y1 = x * 3 y2 = y0 ** y3 return (y0,y1,y2) However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them. Option: Using a dictionary The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a dict . Consider the following: def g(x): y0 = x + 1 y1 = x * 3 y2 = y0 ** y3 return {'y0':y0, 'y1':y1 ,'y2':y2 } (edit- Just to be clear, y0, y1 and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers) Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example, result['y0'] Option: Using a class However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes: class ReturnValue(object): def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2): self.y0 = y0 self.y1 = y1 self.y2 = y2 def g(x): y0 = x + 1 y1 = x * 3 y2 = y0 ** y3 return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2) In python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing- After all { y0, y1, y2 } just end up being entries in the internal __dict__ of the ReturnValue . There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the __slots__ attribute. The class could be expressed as: class ReturnValue(object): __slots__ = [""y0"", ""y1"", ""y2""] def __init__(y0, y1, y2): self.y0 = y0 self.y1 = y1 self.y2 = y2 From the has_links : The __slots__ declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because __dict__ is not created for each instance. Option: Using a list Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard: def h(x): result = [x + 1] result.append(x * 3) result.append(y0 ** y3) return result This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be. A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are has_links , wheras tuples are not. I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types. Question After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best? I've typically found myself going the dictionary route because it involves less set-up work. From a types perspective however, you might be better off going the class route, since that may help you avoid confusing what a dictionary represents. On the other hand, there are some in the Python community that feel has_links , at which point the type of the object really isn't relevant, since you're basically relying on the convention that the same attribute will always have the same meaning.

1579,373818.0,155.0,35360.0,"I really don't understand what the problem is with those people who ask you not to use JavaScript on your site. I went through all sorts of trouble trying to remove a couple of JavaScript scripts I used on one of my sites has_links . A month later, after a relentless attack by spam bots, I decided I better add the JavaScript spam prevention code back in. JavaScript is obviously used by a lot of programmers. It is currently the 6th most popular tag here at Stack Overflow. It is used on practically every single website that I know of. The claim that it is a security risk seems bogus to me. I've had JavaScript on in my browser for as long as I remember, and not once have I found out that anything malicious has happened. JavaScript has, of course, been extended into AJAX. And AJAX is the thing that makes the wonderful world of Web 2.0 work. And that includes this wonderful Stack Overflow site. So is there something I'm missing? Is there something wrong with JavaScript that I'm not aware of? Follow-up: I am flabbergasted by the response to my Question. The responses are strong and vociferous from the Anti-JavaScript people. There was one pro-JavaScript comment, and it was voted down (as I write this to -2) by the others. I turned JavaScript off to add this follow-up. I immediately notice three obvious things (There might be more): A big annoying white on red banner at the top of each page saying: ""Stack Overflow works best with JavaScript enabled"". (Annoyance) Comments cannot be viewed at all or added. You can't vote up or vote down. You can't select the accepted answer. (Loss of functionality) Of course none of the AJAX stuff works. I don't have access to the line of editing tools above this entry box, and I can't see the preview as I type this. (Inconveniences) So as far as I am concerned, turning your JavaScript off results in Annoyances, Loss of Functionality, and Inconvenience. I'm sorry for the handicapped people who have no JavaScript support, but I still don't get why so many of you are so religiously against using it. Personally, I love what AJAX and its beautiful interfaces and enhanced functionality are doing to the Web. I try to add such features to my site and it annoys me when the Anti-JavaScript people ask me - no, demand of me to take it out because they can't access them. But how many of you use Stack Overflow with JavaScript off? None I would expect. Your answer would be that you turn it on for sites you trust like Stack Overflow. Okay. If I make a site that uses Ajax or JavaScript, then I'm fine with you turning it off until you decide to trust my site. But don't expect me to be required to give you all the functionality that I do to people who trust me. Even Stack Overflow doesn't. If someone wants to embellish this idea, I'll give them the accepted answer. Also see the question: has_links and has_links (which, when I last looked, had been voted down by the Do-Not-Use JavaScript people). Followup. I found the following opinion about JavaScript at the has_links : ""Most of the spam hitting your blog originates from bots. Few bots can process JavaScript. Few bots can process cookies. Fewer still, can handle both. In a nutshell, this plugin uses a combo of JavaScript and cookies (on steroids) to weed out the humans from spambots, preventing 99%+ of automated spam from ever getting to your site. Almost 100% of web site visitors will have these turned on by default, so this type of solution works silently in the background, with no inconveniences. There are extremely few users (less than 2%) that have JavaScript and/or cookies turned off by default, but they will be prompted to turn those back on to post their comment. Stats show that among all Internet users, less than 2% have JavaScript turned off, and less than 1% have cookies turned off. This requirement isn’t anything out of the ordinary because most modern websites require the use of JavaScript and cookies for key features — AJAX, for example, won’t work if JS is disabled. Overall, the very few that might be inconvenienced because they have JS and cookies turned off will be far fewer than the 100% who would be annoyed by CAPTCHA’s, challenge questions, and other validation methods.

Why can't I? A: Sorry! try/except is a runtime feature; future_statements are primarily compile-time gimmicks, and your try/except happens long after the compiler is done.

For reference types other than string, == returns true if its two operands refer to the same object. For the string type, == compares the values of the strings. User-defined value types can overload the == operator (see operator). So can user-defined reference types, although by default == behaves as described above for both predefined and user-defined reference types. So why does this code snippet fail to compile? void Compare(T x, T y) { return x == y; } I get the error Operator '==' cannot be applied to operands of type 'T' and 'T' . I wonder why, since as far as I understand the == operator is predefined for all types? Edit: Thanks everybody. I didn't notice at first that the statement was about reference types only. I also thought that bit-by-bit comparison is provided for all value types, which I now know is not correct. But, in case I'm using a reference type, would the the == operator use the predefined reference comparison, or would it use the overloaded version of the operator if a type defined one? Edit 2: Through trial and error, we learned that the == operator will use the predefined reference comparison when using an unrestricted generic type. Actually, the compiler will use the best method it can find for the restricted type argument, but will look no further. For example, the code below will always print true , even when Test.test(new B(), new B()) is called: class A { public static bool operator==(A x, A y) { return true; } } class B : A { public static bool operator==(B x, B y) { return false; } } class Test { void test(T a, T b) where T : A { Console.WriteLine(a == b); } }",Can't operator == be applied to generic types in C#?,10.0,2.0,390919.0,41283.0,2008-12-24 06:32:28,<c#><generics><operators><equals-operator>,,1.0,2351.0

Now this immediately struck me as potentially problematic from a security perspective. So I started doing some research into the security aspects of JSON and across this blog post about how has_links . This part stuck out: Update: If you are doing JSON 100% properly, then you will only have objects at the top level. Arrays, Strings, Numbers, etc will all be wrapped. A JSON object will then fail to eval() because the JavaScript interpreter will think it's looking at a block rather than an object. This goes a long way to protecting against these attacks, however it's still best to protect your secure data with un-predictable URLs. Ok, so that's a good rule to start with: JSON objects at the top level should always be objects and never arrays, numbers or strings. Sounds like a good rule to me.

My expertise is in Java, so naturally Grails seemed like a good choice. At first I thought of using Spring, JPA and Hibernate, but I’ve used that previously and have run into all sorts of tedious configuration and coding work. Grails advertises itself as solving this. My biggest frustration with Grails is all of the little things that don't work. What I mean is that it doesn't work as one would intuitively think it should. It's very rough around the edges. I run into problems constantly. Sometimes it's my lack of Grails understanding — other times I've discovered legitimate Grails bugs. One major issue is the lack of good Eclipse integration. There is a Groovy and Grails plugin, but it doesn't do much other than syntax highlighting. Calling Groovy from Java and vice versa is very painful to has_links . Not having good IDE support is a major bummer. What happens is I sit down trying to develop my web application.

Much if my issues with exceptions comes from 1) accessing data via a remote service or 2) deserializing a JSON object. Unfortunately I can't guarantee success for either of these tasks (cut network connection, malformed JSON object that is out of my control). As a result, if I do encounter an exception I simply catch it within the function and return FALSE to the caller. My logic is that all the caller really cares about is if the task was successful, not why it is wasn't successful. Here's some sample code (in JAVA) of a typical method) public boolean doSomething(Object p_somthingToDoOn) { boolean result = false; try{ // if dirty object then clean doactualStuffOnObject(p_jsonObject); //assume success (no exception thrown) result = true; } catch(Exception Ex) { //don't care about exceptions Ex.printStackTrace(); } return result; } I think this approach is fine, but I'm really curious to know what the best practices are for managing exceptions (should I really bubble an exception all the way up a call stack?). In summary of key questions: Is it okay to just catch exceptions but not bubble them up or formally notifying the system (either via a log or a notification to the user)? What best practices are there for exceptions that don't result in everything requiring a try/catch block? Follow Up/Edit Thanks for all the feedback, found some excellent sources on exception management online: has_links has_links has_links (Article now points to archive.org copy) has_links It seems that exception management is one of those things that vary based on context. But most importantly, one should be consistent in how they manage exceptions within a system. Additionally watch out for code-rot via excessive try/catches or not giving a exception its respect (an exception is warning the system, what else needs to be warned?). Also, this is a pretty choice comment from has_links . I tend to agree with Anders Hejlsberg and you that the most callers only care if operation is successful or not. From this comment it brings up some questions to think about when dealing with exceptions: What is the point this exception being thrown? How does it make sense to handle it? Does the caller really care about the exception or do they just care if the call was successful? Is forcing a caller to manage a potential exception graceful? Are you being respectful to the idoms of the language? Do you really need to return a success flag like boolean? Returning boolean (or an int) is more of a C mindset than a Java (in Java you would just handle the exception) one.

You are pulling my leg, right? No, I'm not going to take the cheap stab at this by saying, ""hang on, the method is implemented - it throws a NotImplementedException."" Yes, that's right, you have to implement the method to throw a NotImplementedException (unlike a pure virtual function call in C++ - now that makes sense!). While that's pretty damn funny, there is a more serious problem in my mind. I just wonder, in the presence of the NotImplementedException, how can anyone do anything with .Net? Are you expected to wrap every abstract method call with a try catch block to guard against methods that might not be implemented? If you catch such an exception, what the heck are you supposed to do with it?? I see no way to test if a method is actually implemented without calling it. Since calling it may have side effects, I can't do all my checks up-front and then run my algorithm. I have to run my algorithm, catch NotImplementedExceptions and the some how roll back my application to some sane state. It's crazy. Mad. Insane. So the question is: Why does the NotImplementedException exist ? As a preemptive strike, I do not want anyone to respond with, ""because designers need to put this in the auto-generated code."" This is horrid. I would rather the auto-generated code not compile until you supply an implementation. For example, the auto generated implementation could be ""throw NotImplementedException;"" where the NotImplementedException is not defined! Has anyone ever caught and handled a NotImplementedException? Have you ever left a NotImplementedException in your code? If so, did this represent a time bomb (ie, you accidentally left it there), or a design flaw (the method should not be implemented and will never be called)? I'm very suspicious of the NotSupportedException also... Not supported? What the? If it's not supported, why is it part of your interface? Can anyone at Microsoft spell improper inheritance? But I might start another question for that if I don't get too abuse for this one. Additional info: has_links is an interesting read on the subject. There seems to be a strong agreement with has_links that ""NotImplementedException is for functionality that is just not yet implemented, but really should (and will be). Something like what you might start with when you are building a class, get all the methods there throwing NotImplementedException, then flush them out with real code…"" Comments from has_links are very weak and should probably be ignored: NotImplementedException: Throw this exception when a type does not implement a method for any other reason.

System.Configuration.ConfigurationException The exception that is thrown when a configuration system error has occurred. Remarks The ConfigurationException exception is thrown if the application attempts to read or write data to the configuration file but is unsuccessful. Some possible reasons for this can include malformed XML in the configuration file, file permission issues, and configuration properties with values that are not valid. Note: The ConfigurationException object is maintained for backward compatibility. The ConfigurationErrorsException object replaces it for the configuration system. This exception actually sounds perfect for what I need, but it's been marked obsolete, so, ixnay on atthay. This brings us to the thoroughly puzzling has_links : System.Configuration.ConfigurationErrorsException The current value is not one of the EnableSessionState values.

In a nutshell, I need a standard exception that should be thrown when an application configuration setting is missing or contains an invalid value. You'd think the Framework had such an exception baked into it for applications to use. (It apparently did, but it was marked obsolete, and was replaced by something much larger in scope.) What solutions, if any, are you guys using for this, and am I going to have to suck it up and roll my own exception for this? Edit Addenda Some have asked whether or not I could provide a default value, and continue. In certain cases, yes, and in those cases, the exception would not be thrown. However, for certain settings, this won't apply. For instance: database server names and credentials, authentication servers, and paths to installed third party applications. It is also worth noting that the application I'm primarily working on is a console application running in batch mode, and I want it to throw an exception that is caught by the main method and logged appropriately if the thing isn't appropriately configured.

Basically, isset() doesn't check for whether the variable is set at all, but whether it's set to anything but NULL . Given that, what's the best way to actually check for the existence of a variable? I tried something like: if(isset($v) || @is_null($v)) (the @ is necessary to avoid the warning when $v is not set) but is_null() has a similar problem to isset() : it returns TRUE on unset variables! It also appears that: @($v === NULL) works exactly like @is_null($v) , so that's out, too. How are we supposed to reliably check for the existence of a variable in PHP? Edit: there is clearly a difference in PHP between variables that are not set, and variables that are set to NULL : NULL); var_dump($a); PHP shows that $a['b'] exists, and has a NULL value. If you add: var_dump(isset($a['b'])); var_dump(isset($a['c'])); you can see the ambiguity I'm talking about with the isset() function. Here's the output of all three of these var_dump()s : array(1) { [""b""]=> NULL } bool(false) bool(false) Further edit: two things. One, a use case. An array being turned into the data of an SQL UPDATE statement, where the array's keys are the table's columns, and the array's values are the values to be applied to each column. Any of the table's columns can hold a NULL value, signified by passing a NULL value in the array. You need a way to differentiate between an array key not existing, and an array's value being set to NULL ; that's the difference between not updating the column's value and updating the column's value to NULL . Second, has_links , array_key_exists() works correctly, for my above use case and for any global variables: outputs: bool(true) bool(false) Since that properly handles just about everywhere I can see there being any ambiguity between variables that don't exist and variables that are set to NULL , I'm calling array_key_exists() the official easiest way in PHP to truly check for the existence of a variable .

I know that this is standard procedure for a struct: the backing field for any property must be assigned directly (and not via the property's set accessor) from within the struct's constructor. A solution is to use an explicit backing field: struct MyStruct { public MyStruct(int size) { _size = size; } private int _size; public int Size { get { return _size; } set { _size = value; } } } (Note that VB.NET would not have this issue, because in VB.NET all fields are automatically initialized to 0/null/false when first created.) This would seem to be an unfortunate limitation when using automatic properties with structs in C#.

However, our data is very structured, and perhaps some kind of tiered approach might work?

Then directions for two far-away points will involve local directions to a key points, global directions to another key point, and then local directions again.)

I'm hosting it on my C# in Depth site, which is vanilla ASP.NET 3.5 (i.e. not MVC). The flow is very simple: If a user enters the app with a URL which doesn't specify all the parameters (or if any of them are invalid) I want to just display the user input controls. (There are only two.) If a user enters the app with a URL which does have all the required parameters, I want to display the results and the input controls (so they can change the parameters) Here are my self-imposed requirements (mixture of design and implementation): I want the submission to use GET rather than POST, mostly so users can bookmark the page easily. I don't want the URL to end up looking silly after submission, with extraneous bits and pieces on it. Just the main URL and the real parameters please. Ideally I'd like to avoid requiring JavaScript at all. There's no good reason for it in this app. I want to be able to access the controls during render time and set values etc. In particular, I want to be able to set the default values of the controls to the parameter values passed in, if ASP.NET can't do this automatically for me (within the other restrictions). I'm happy to do all the parameter validation myself, and I don't need much in the way of server side events. It's really simple to set everything on page load instead of attaching events to buttons etc. Most of this is okay, but I haven't found any way of completely removing the viewstate and keeping the rest of the useful functionality. Using the post from has_links I've managed to avoid getting any actual value for the viewstate - but it still ends up as a parameter on the URL, which looks really ugly. If I make it a plain HTML form instead of an ASP.NET form (i.e. take out runat=""server"" ) then I don't get any magic viewstate - but then I can't access the controls programmatically. I could do all of this by ignoring most of ASP.NET and building up an XML document with LINQ to XML, and implementing IHttpHandler . That feels a bit low level though. I realise that my problems could be solved by either relaxing my constraints (e.g. using POST and not caring about the surplus parameter) or by using ASP.NET MVC, but are my requirements really unreasonable? Maybe ASP.NET just doesn't scale down to this sort of app? There's a very likely alternative though: I'm just being stupid, and there's a perfectly simple way of doing it that I just haven't found.

This is different from has_links for which you can use int(xxx, 16), but instead I want to convert a string of actual byte values.

However, in my company, we are required to set objectives for all staff, and are encouraged by Human Resources to make them has_links . In the past, my fellow first-level managers (team leads) and I have tried a number of approaches: Set measurable objectives that are additional to the normal job, like ""Do training on technology X"", ""Create documentation for piece of code Y that no-one understands"" and so on. When it comes to the annual performance evaluation, rate developers not on the written objectives, but rather on my opinion of the unmeasurable value of their normal work, since that is actually what the company cares about. Set very specific objectives like ""days' work done as recorded by the task management system"", ""number of bugs introduced"", ""number of production issued caused"". This led to inflated estimates and incorrect classification of bugs, in order to achieve better ""scores"". Interestingly, even those developers scoring highly on this system didn't like it, as the intrinsic trust within the team was damaged and they didn't always feel they deserved their high position. Set vague objectives that are variants on ""Do your normal job well"". When it comes to the annual evaluation, their rating does reflect performance against the objectives, but the objectives themselves are not measurable or achievable, which is frowned upon.

Short explanation: caching / web farms make it impossible for us to actually track hits, and any workaround (sending a non-cached web-beacon, writing to a unified table, etc.) slows the site down worse than the bots would. There is likely some pricey bit of hardware from Cisco or the like that can help at a high level, but it's hard to justify the cost if CAPTCHAing everyone is an alternative.

I've added bounty to this question and attempted to explain why the current answers don't fit our needs. First, though, thanks to all of you who have thought about this, it's amazing to have this collective intelligence to help work through seemingly impossible problems. I'll be a little more clear than I was before: This is about the bag o' crap sales on woot.com. I'm the president of Woot Workshop, the subsidiary of Woot that does the design, writes the product descriptions, podcasts, blog posts, and moderates the forums. I work in the css/html world and am only barely familiar with the rest of the developer world. I work closely with the developers and have talked through all of the answers here (and many other ideas we've had). Usability of the site is a massive part of my job, and making the site exciting and fun is most of the rest of it. That's where the three goals below derive. CAPTCHA harms usability, and bots steal the fun and excitement out of our crap sales. To set up the scenario a little more, bots are slamming our front page tens of times a second screenscraping (and/or scanning our rss) for the Random Crap sale. The moment they see that, it triggers a second stage of the program that logs in, clicks I want One, fills out the form, and buys the crap. In current (2/6/2009) order of votes: has_links : On stackoverflow and other sites that use this method, they're almost always dealing with authenticated (logged in) users, because the task being attempted requires that. On Woot, anonymous (non-logged) users can view our home page. In other words, the slamming bots can be non-authenticated (and essentially non-trackable except by IP address). So we're back to scanning for IPs, which a) is fairly useless in this age of cloud networking and spambot zombies and b) catches too many innocents given the number of businesses that come from one IP address (not to mention the issues with non-static IP ISPs and potential performance hits to trying to track this). Oh, and having people call us would be the worst possible scenario. Can we have them call you? has_links Ned Batchelder's methods look pretty cool, but they're pretty firmly designed to defeat bots built for a network of sites. Our problem is bots are built specifically to defeat our site.

1709,458802.0,68.0,5171.0,"I'd like the community's take on some thoughts I've had about Linq to Sql and other ORM mappers. I like Linq to Sql and the idea of expressing data access logic (or CRUD operations in general) in your native development tongue rather than having to deal with the ""impedance mismatch"" between C# and SQL. For example, to return an ObjectDataSource-compatible list of Event instances for a business layer, we use: return db.Events.Select(c => new EventData() { EventID = c.EventID, Title = c.Title }) If I were to implement this using old SQL-to-C# constructs, I'd have to create a Command class, add the EventID parameter (using a string to describe the ""@EventID"" argument), add the SQL query string to the Command class, execute the command, and then use (cast-type)nwReader[""FieldName""] to pull each returned field value and assign it to a member of a newly created instance of my EventData class (yuck). So, that is why people like Linq/SubSonic/etc. and I agree. However, in the bigger picture I see a number of things that are wrong. My sense is that Microsoft also sees something wrong and that is why they are has_links and trying to move people to Linq to Entities. Only, I think that Microsoft is doubling-down on a bad bet. So, what is wrong? The problem is that there are has_links , especially at Microsoft, who look at Linq to Sql and realize that it is not a true data management tool: there are still many things you cannot do easily of comfortably in C# and they aim to fix it. You see this manifested in the ambitions behind Linq to Entities, blog posts about the has_links nature of Linq and even the has_links . And the problem with that is that it assumes that SQL is the problem. That is, in order to reduce a mild discomfort (impedance mismatch between SQL and C#), Microsoft has proposed the equivalent of a space suit (full isolation) when a band-aid (Linq to SQL or something similar) would do just fine. As far as I can see, developers are quite smart enough to master the relational model and then apply it intelligently in their development efforts. In fact, I would go one further and say that Linq to SQL, SubSonic, etc. are already too complex: the learning curve isn't that much different from mastering SQL itself. Since, for the foreseeable future, developers must master SQL and the relational model, we're now faced with learning two query / CRUD languages. Worse yet, Linq is often difficult to test (you don't have a query window), removes us one layer from the real work we are doing (it generates SQL), and has very clumsy support (at best) for SQL constructs like Date handling (e.g. DateDiff), ""Having"" and even ""Group By"". What is the alternative? Personally, I don't need a different model for data access like Linq to Entities. I'd prefer to simply pop up a window in Visual Studio, enter and validate my SQL, and then press a button to generate or supplement a C# class to encapsulate the call. Since you already know SQL, wouldn't you prefer to just enter something like this: Select EventID, Title From Events Where Location=@Location and end up with an EventData class that A) contains the EventID and Title fields as properties and B) has a factory method that takes a 'Location' string as an argument and that generates a List? You'd have to think carefully about the object model (the above example obviously doesn't deal with that) but the fundamental approach of still using SQL while eliminating the impedance mismatch appeals to me a great deal. The question is: am I wrong? Should Microsoft rewrite the SQL infrastructure so that you don't have to learn SQL / relational data management any more? Can they rewrite the SQL infrastructure in this way? Or do you think that a very thin layer on top of SQL to eliminate the pain of setting up parameters and accessing data fields is quite sufficient? Update I wanted to promote two links to the top because I think that they capture important aspects of what I am after. First, CodeMonkey points out an article entitled has_links It takes a while to get started but is a very interesting read. Second, AnSGri points to one of Joel Spolsky's more prominent pieces: has_links . It isn't exactly on topic but it is close and is a great read. Update 2: I've given the ""answer"" to ocdecio although there are many great answers here and the choice of the ""right"" answer is purely subjective. In this case, his answer squared with what I think is truly the best practice given the current state of technology. This is an area that I fully expect to evolve, however, so things may well change.

1715,463105.0,152.0,18600.0,"This is a long text. Please bear with me. Boiled down, the question is: Is there a workable in-place radix sort algorithm ? Preliminary I've got a huge number of small fixed-length strings that only use the letters “A”, “C”, “G” and “T” (yes, you've guessed it: has_links ) that I want to sort. At the moment, I use std::sort which uses has_links in all common implementations of the has_links . This works quite well. However, I'm convinced that has_links fits my problem set perfectly and should work much better in practice. Details I've tested this assumption with a very naive implementation and for relatively small inputs (on the order of 10,000) this was true (well, at least more than twice as fast). However, runtime degrades abysmally when the problem size becomes larger ( N > 5,000,000). The reason is obvious: radix sort requires copying the whole data (more than once in my naive implementation, actually). This means that I've put ~ 4 GiB into my main memory which obviously kills performance. Even if it didn't, I can't afford to use this much memory since the problem sizes actually become even larger. Use Cases Ideally, this algorithm should work with any string length between 2 and 100, for DNA as well as DNA5 (which allows an additional wildcard character “N”), or even DNA with has_links has_links (resulting in 16 distinct values). However, I realize that all these cases cannot be covered, so I'm happy with any speed improvement I get. The code can decide dynamically which algorithm to dispatch to. Research Unfortunately, the has_links is useless. The section about an in-place variant is complete rubbish. The has_links is next to nonexistent. There's a promising-sounding paper called has_links which describes the algorithm “MSL”. Unfortunately, this paper, too, is disappointing. In particular, there are the following things. First, the algorithm contains several mistakes and leaves a lot unexplained. In particular, it doesn’t detail the recursion call (I simply assume that it increments or reduces some pointer to calculate the current shift and mask values). Also, it uses the functions dest_group and dest_address without giving definitions. I fail to see how to implement these efficiently (that is, in O(1); at least dest_address isn’t trivial). Last but not least, the algorithm achieves in-place-ness by swapping array indices with elements inside the input array. This obviously only works on numerical arrays. I need to use it on strings. Of course, I could just screw strong typing and go ahead assuming that the memory will tolerate my storing an index where it doesn’t belong. But this only works as long as I can squeeze my strings into 32 bits of memory (assuming 32 bit integers). That's only 16 characters (let's ignore for the moment that 16 > log(5,000,000)). Another paper by one of the authors gives no accurate description at all, but it gives MSL’s runtime as sub-linear which is flat out wrong.

Indicate if the project is crossplatform, mature, active, and give an example if possible. Please use this wiki to discuss only Open Source projects. This is the list so far (in alphabetical order): Fudgets has_links is a Haskell library. Platform: Unix. Status: Experimental, but still maintained. An example: import Fudgets main = fudlogue (shellF ""Hello"" (labelF ""Hello, world!"" >+< quitButtonF)) GNUstep Renaissance has_links allows to describe GUI in simple XML. Platforms: OSX/GNUstep. Status: part of GNUstep. An example below: Click the button below to quit the application HTML HTML-based GUI (HTML + JS). Crossplatform, mature. Can be used entirely on the client side. Looking for a nice “helloworld” example. JavaFX has_links is usable for standalone (desktop) apps as well as for web applications. Not completely crossplatform, not yet completely open source.

Phooey has_links is another Haskell library. Crossplatform (wxWidgets), HTML+JS backend planned. Mature and active. An example (a little more than a helloworld): ui1 :: UI () ui1 = title ""Shopping List"" $ do a <- title ""apples"" $ islider (0,10) 3 b <- title ""bananas"" $ islider (0,10) 7 title ""total"" $ showDisplay (liftA2 (+) a b) PythonCard has_links describes GUI in a Python dictionary. Crossplatform (wxWidgets). Some apps use it, but the project seems stalled. There is an active fork. I skip has_links because it is too verbose for the contest. Shoes has_links for Ruby.

I enjoyed the presentation and learned that a lot of the attributes of functional programming make it much easier to avoid threading/concurrency issues.

But I have read that Erlang is used in highly scalable applications (the whole reason Ericsson created it in the first place). How can it be efficient handling thousands of requests per second if everything is handled as a synchronously processed message? Isn't that why we started moving towards asynchronous processing - so we can take advantage of running multiple threads of operation at the same time and achieve scalability? It seems like this architecture, while safer, is a step backwards in terms of scalability. What am I missing?

But I've run into a pretty non-trivial challenge (one that most auth libraries miss entirely, but I insist on handling it properly): how to deal intelligently with large-scale, distributed, variable-username brute-force attacks . I know all the usual tricks: Limiting # of failed attempts per IP/host and denying the offenders access (e.g. Fail2Ban) - which no longer works has_links Combining the above with a blacklist of known 'bad' IPs/hosts (e.g. DenyHosts) - which relies on botnets falling for #1, has_links IP/host whitelists combined with traditional auth (sadly useless with dynamic IP users and the high churn on most web sites) Setting a sitewide limit on # of failed attempts within a N minute/hour period, and throttling (suspending) all login attempts after that for a number of minutes/hours (with the problem that DoS attacking you becomes botnet child's play) Mandatory digital signatures (public-key certificates) or RSA hardware tokens for all users with NO login/password option (without question a rock-solid solution, but only practical for closed, dedicated services) Enforced ultra-strong password schemes (e.g. >25 nonsense characters with symbols - again, too impractical for casual users) And finally, CAPTCHAs (which could work in most cases, but are annoying for users and has_links against a has_links ) Now, these are just the theoretically workable ideas. There are plenty of rubbish ideas that blow the site wide open (e.g. to trivial DoS attacks). What I want is something better. And by better, I mean: It has to be secure(+) against DoS and brute-force attacks, and not introduce any new vulnerabilities that might allow a slightly sneakier bot to continue operating under the radar It has to be automated. If it requires a human operator to verify each login or monitor suspicious activity, it's not going to work in a real-world scenario It has to be feasible for mainstream web use (ie. high churn, high volume, and open registration that can be performed by non-programmers) It can't impede the user experience to the point where casual users will get annoyed or frustrated (and potentially abandon the site) It can't involve kittens, unless they are really really secure kittens (+) By 'secure', I mean at least as secure as a paranoid user's ability to keep his password secret So - let's hear it!

Post discussion update: Thanks for all the helpful responses. I ended up doing has_links . The simplest explanation for why java.lang.Number does not implement Comparable is rooted in mutability concerns. For a bit of review, java.lang.Number is the abstract super-type of AtomicInteger , AtomicLong , BigDecimal , BigInteger , Byte , Double , Float , Integer , Long and Short . On that list, AtomicInteger and AtomicLong to do not implement Comparable . Digging around, I discovered that it is not a good practice to implement Comparable on mutable types because the objects can change during or after comparison rendering the result of the comparison useless. Both AtomicLong and AtomicInteger are mutable. The API designers had the forethought to not have Number implement Comparable because it would have constrained implementation of future subtypes.

The last time I used a text editor for writing code was back when I was still writing HTML in Notepad about 1000 years ago. Since then, I've been more or less IDE dependent, having used Visual Studio, NetBeans, IntelliJ, Borland/Codegear Studio, and Eclipse for my entire career. For what it's worth, I have tried Emacs, and my experience was a frustrating one because of its complete lack of out-of-the-box discoverable features.

1816,521893.0,202.0,12687.0,"Sorry for the waffly title - if I could come up with a concise title, I wouldn't have to ask the question. Suppose I have an immutable list type. It has an operation Foo(x) which returns a new immutable list with the specified argument as an extra element at the end. So to build up a list of strings with values ""Hello"", ""immutable"", ""world"" you could write: var empty = new ImmutableList(); var list1 = empty.Foo(""Hello""); var list2 = list1.Foo(""immutable""); var list3 = list2.Foo(""word""); (This is C# code, and I'm most interested in a C# suggestion if you feel the language is important. It's not fundamentally a language question, but the idioms of the language may be important.) The important thing is that the existing lists are not altered by Foo - so empty.Count would still return 0. Another (more idiomatic) way of getting to the end result would be: var list = new ImmutableList().Foo(""Hello"") .Foo(""immutable"") .Foo(""word""); My question is: what's the best name for Foo? EDIT 3 : As I reveal later on, the name of the type might not actually be ImmutableList , which makes the position clear. Imagine instead that it's TestSuite and that it's immutable because the whole of the framework it's a part of is immutable... (End of edit 3) Options I've come up with so far: Add : common in .NET, but implies mutation of the original list Cons : I believe this is the normal name in functional languages, but meaningless to those without experience in such languages Plus : my favourite so far, it doesn't imply mutation to me . Apparently this is also has_links but with slightly different expectations (a Haskell programmer might expect it to add two lists together rather than adding a single value to the other list). With : consistent with some other immutable conventions, but doesn't have quite the same ""additionness"" to it IMO. And : not very descriptive. Operator overload for + : I really don't like this much; I generally think operators should only be applied to lower level types. I'm willing to be persuaded though! The criteria I'm using for choosing are: Gives the correct impression of the result of the method call (i.e. that it's the original list with an extra element) Makes it as clear as possible that it doesn't mutate the existing list Sounds reasonable when chained together as in the second example above Please ask for more details if I'm not making myself clear enough... EDIT 1: Here's my reasoning for preferring Plus to Add . Consider these two lines of code: list.Add(foo); list.Plus(foo); In my view (and this is a personal thing) the latter is clearly buggy - it's like writing ""x + 5;"" as a statement on its own. The first line looks like it's okay, until you remember that it's immutable. In fact, the way that the plus operator on its own doesn't mutate its operands is another reason why Plus is my favourite. Without the slight ickiness of operator overloading, it still gives the same connotations, which include (for me) not mutating the operands (or method target in this case). EDIT 2: Reasons for not liking Add. Various answers are effectively: ""Go with Add. That's what DateTime does, and String has Replace methods etc which don't make the immutability obvious."" I agree - there's precedence here. However, I've seen plenty of people call DateTime.Add or String.Replace and expect mutation . There are loads of newsgroup questions (and probably SO ones if I dig around) which are answered by ""You're ignoring the return value of String.Replace ; strings are immutable, a new string gets returned."" Now, I should reveal a subtlety to the question - the type might not actually be an immutable list, but a different immutable type. In particular, I'm working on a benchmarking framework where you add tests to a suite, and that creates a new suite. It might be obvious that: var list = new ImmutableList(); list.Add(""foo""); isn't going to accomplish anything, but it becomes a lot murkier when you change it to: var suite = new TestSuite(); suite.Add(x => x.Length); That looks like it should be okay. Whereas this, to me, makes the mistake clearer: var suite = new TestSuite(); suite.Plus(x => x.Length); That's just begging to be: var suite = new TestSuite().Plus(x => x.Length); Ideally, I would like my users not to have to be told that the test suite is immutable. I want them to fall into the pit of success. This may not be possible, but I'd like to try. I apologise for over-simplifying the original question by talking only about an immutable list type.

Namely sections of a page needed a header: +---------------------------------------------------------+ | Title Button | +---------------------------------------------------------+ Pretty simple stuff. Thing is table hatred seems to have taken over in the Web world, which I was reminded of when I asked has_links Now the general topic of tables vs divs/CSS has previously been discussed, for example: has_links ; and has_links . So this isn't intended to be a general discussion about CSS vs tables for layout. This is simply the solution to one problem. I tried various solutions to the above using CSS including: Float right for the button or a div containing the button; Position relative for the button; and Position relative+absolute. None of these solutions were satisfactory for different reasons. For example the relative positioning resulted in a z-index issue where my dropdown menu appeared under the content. So I ended up going back to: .group-header { background-color: yellow; width: 100%; } .group-header td { padding: 8px; } .group-title { text-align: left; font-weight: bold; } .group-buttons { text-align: right; } Title And it works perfectly. It's simple, as backward compatibile as it gets (that'll work probably even on IE5) and it just works. No messing about with positioning or floats. So can anyone do the equivalent without tables? The requirements are: Backwards compatible: to FF2 and IE6; Reasonably consistent: across different browsers; Vertically centered: the button and title are of different heights; and Flexible: allow reasonably precise control over positioning (padding and/or margin) and styling. On a side note, I came across a couple of interesting articles today: has_links ; and has_links EDIT: Let me elaborate on the float issue. This sort of works: Layout .group-header, .group-content { width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; } .group-header { border: 1px solid red; background: yellow; overflow: hidden; } .group-content { border: 1px solid black; background: #DDD; } .group-title { float: left; padding: 8px; } .group-buttons { float: right; padding: 8px; } This is my title And it works perfectly.

Don't let there ever be two copies running at once (detect if a copy is already running and don't launch it in that case). I have a simple script or command line command that I'd like to keep executing repeatedly forever (with a short pause between runs). Again, don't allow two copies of the script to ever be running at once. Of course it's trivial to write a ""while(true)"" loop around the script in case 2 and then apply a solution for case 1, but a more general solution will just solve case 2 directly since that applies to the script in case 1 as well (you may just want a shorter or no pause if the script is not intended to ever die (of course if the script really does never die then the pause doesn't actually matter)). Note that the solution should not involve, say, adding file-locking code or PID recording to the existing scripts. More specifically, I'd like a program ""daemonize"" that I can run like % daemonize myscript arg1 arg2 or, for example, % daemonize 'echo `date` >> /tmp/times.txt' which would keep a growing list of dates appended to times.txt. (Note that if the argument(s) to daemonize is a script that runs forever as in case 1 above, then daemonize will still do the right thing, restarting it when necessary.) I could then put a command like above in my .login and/or cron it hourly or minutely (depending on how worried I was about it dying unexpectedly). NB: The daemonize script will need to remember the command string it is daemonizing so that if the same command string is daemonized again it does not launch a second copy. Also, the solution should ideally work on both OS X and linux but solutions for one or the other are welcome. EDIT: It's fine if you have to invoke it with sudo daemonize myscript myargs .

Rainbow tables are more complex creatures, and are actually a variant of Hellman Hash Chains. Though I believe the answer is still the same (since it doesnt come down to cryptanalysis), some of the discussion might be a bit skewed. The question: "" has_links "" Typically, I always recommend using a cryptographically-strong random value as salt, to be used with hash functions (e.g. for passwords), such as to protect against Rainbow Table attacks. But is it actually cryptographically necessary for the salt to be random? Would any unique value (unique per user, e.g. userId) suffice in this regard? It would in fact prevent using a single Rainbow Table to crack all (or most) passwords in the system... But does lack of entropy really weaken the cryptographic strength of the hash functions? Note, I am not asking about why to use salt, how to protect it (it doesnt need to be), using a single constant hash (don't), or what kind of hash function to use. Just whether salt needs entropy or not. Thanks all for the answers so far, but I'd like to focus on the areas I'm (a little) less familiar with. Mainly implications for cryptanalysis - I'd appreciate most if anyone has some input from the crypto-mathematical PoV. Also, if there are additional vectors that hadn't been considered, thats great input too (see @Dave Sherohman point on multiple systems). Beyond that, if you have any theory, idea or best practice - please back this up either with proof, attack scenario, or empirical evidence. Or even valid considerations for acceptable trade-offs... I'm familiar with Best Practice (capital B capital P) on the subject, I'd like to prove what value this actually provides. EDIT: Some really good answers here, but I think as @Dave says, it comes down to Rainbow Tables for common user names... and possible less common names too. However, what if my usernames are globally unique? Not necessarily unique for my system, but per each user - e.g. email address. There would be no incentive to build a RT for a single user (as @Dave emphasized, the salt is not kept secret), and this would still prevent clustering. Only issue would be that I might have the same email and password on a different site - but salt wouldnt prevent that anyway. So, it comes back down to cryptanalysis - IS the entropy necessary, or not?

I've programmed plenty the last several years but just lately I've been getting more into theoretical ideas about organizing code, design patterns, differences in languages, etc. I have a Java class, so I've dropped my C++ research/development and moved into Java and JOGL (Java OpenGL). It's wonderful! But that's beside the point. I want to make a small role-playing game, but this question really applies to any sort of game. How do you organize the game objects in a way that is structured, like the Model-View-Controller pattern? It looks to be an amazing pattern, very widely used and makes a lot of sense, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to implement it. For instance, I need to keep track of a GL object for drawing to the screen. I have to have classes that implement MouseListener, MouseMotionListener, MouseWheelListener, and KeyListener (or one class, an all-in-one input manager). And I have to put my game data somewhere where all these different classes can access and modify it; if someone presses a button on the keyboard, the input managing class needs to somehow perform the action that the key is mapped to; when a frame needs to be drawn, the graphics class needs to find a way to loop through all the different 'things' and draw them all. And my biggest issue, the GUI; where does it tie into it all? It's something like the input, but not quite, and it needs to both set and get pieces of data from the actual game simulation... And complicating it even MORE is if I decide to try and add networking, which (similar to the GUI) also needs to have access to a lot of the data for modifying and reading... Oh, I'm just all confused. I don't know how to make all this work together in an object-oriented fashion... It's easy enough writing things that clearly fit the patterns, but when you have tons of things happening all tied to one game loop, modifying each other and the game data and so on, ... I don't even know any more. Maybe I'm just making this a bigger deal than it actually is. Has anyone else felt this way?

1882,573872.0,292.0,73022.0,"I like instantiating my WCF service clients within a using block as it's pretty much the standard way to use resources that implement IDisposable : using (var client = new SomeWCFServiceClient()) { //Do something with the client } But, as noted in has_links , wrapping a WCF client in a using block could mask any errors that result in the client being left in a faulted state (like a timeout or communication problem). Long story short, when Dispose() is called, the client's Close() method fires, but throws an error because it's in a faulted state. The original exception is then masked by the second exception. Not good. The suggested workaround in the MSDN article is to completely avoid using a using block, and to instead instantiate your clients and use them something like this: try { ... client.Close(); } catch (CommunicationException e) { ... client.Abort(); } catch (TimeoutException e) { ... client.Abort(); } catch (Exception e) { ... client.Abort(); throw; } Compared to the using block, I think that's ugly. And a lot of code to write each time you need a client. Luckily, I found a few other workarounds, such as this one on has_links . You start with: public delegate void UseServiceDelegate(T proxy); public static class Service { public static ChannelFactory _channelFactory = new ChannelFactory(""""); public static void Use(UseServiceDelegate codeBlock) { IClientChannel proxy = (IClientChannel)_channelFactory.CreateChannel(); bool success = false; try { codeBlock((T)proxy); proxy.Close(); success = true; } finally { if (!success) { proxy.Abort(); } } } } Which then allows: Service.Use(orderService => { orderService.PlaceOrder(request); }); That's not bad, but I don't think it's as expressive and easily understandable as the using block. The workaround I'm currently trying to use I first read about on has_links . Basically you override the client's Dispose() method wherever you use it. Something like: public partial class SomeWCFServiceClient : IDisposable { void IDisposable.Dispose() { if (this.State == CommunicationState.Faulted) { this.Abort(); } else { this.Close(); } } } This appears to be able to allow the using block again without the danger of masking a faulted state exception.

Considerations: ""Good Web design"" requires non-idempotent actions to be sent via POST. This is a non-idempotent action. It is easier to develop and debug this app when the request parameters are present in the URL. The API is not intended for widespread use. It seems like making a POST request with no body will take a bit more work, e.g. a Content-Length: 0 header must be explicitly added. It also seems to me that a POST with no body is a bit counter to most developer's and HTTP frameworks' expectations. Are there any more pitfalls or advantages to sending parameters on a POST request via the URL query rather than the request body? Edit: The reason this is under consideration is that the operations are not idempotent and have side effects other than retrieval. See has_links : In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered ""safe"". This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested. ...

Since it turns out that simply getting the table's borders to collapse does not solve the root problem, I have updated the title to better reflect the discussion. I am trying to make a table with rounded corners using the CSS3 border-radius property. The table styles I'm using look something like this: table { -moz-border-radius:10px; -webkit-border-radius:10px; border-radius:10px } Here's the problem. I also want to set the border-collapse:collapse property, and when that is set border-radius no longer works. Is there a CSS-based way I can get the same effect as border-collapse:collapse without actually using it? Edits: I've made a simple page to demonstrate the problem has_links (Firefox/Safari only). It seems that a large part of the problem is that setting the table to have rounded corners does not affect the corners of the corner td elements. If the table was all one color, this wouldn't be a problem since I could just make the top and bottom td corners rounded for the first and last row respectively. However, I am using different background colors for the table to differentiate the headings and for striping, so the inner td elements would show their rounded corners as well. Summary of proposed solutions: Surrounding the table with another element with round corners doesn't work because the table's square corners ""bleed through."" Specifying border width to 0 doesn't collapse the table. Bottom td corners still square after setting cellspacing to zero. Using JavaScript instead- works by avoiding the problem. Possible solutions: The tables are generated in PHP, so I could just apply a different class to each of the outer th/tds and style each corner separately. I'd rather not do this, since it's not very elegant and a bit of a pain to apply to multiple tables, so please keep suggestions coming. Possible solution 2 is to use JavaScript (jQuery, specifically) to style the corners. This solution also works, but still not quite what I'm looking for (I know I'm picky). I have two reservations: this is a very lightweight site, and I'd like to keep JavaScript to the barest minimum part of the appeal that using border-radius has for me is graceful degradation and progressive enhancement. By using border-radius for all rounded corners, I hope to have a consistently rounded site in CSS3-capable browsers and a consistently square site in others (I'm looking at you, IE). I know that trying to do this with CSS3 today may seem needless, but I have my reasons. I would also like to point out that this problem is a result of the w3c specification, not poor CSS3 support, so any solution will still be relevant and useful when CSS3 has more widespread support.",CSS3's border-radius property and border-collapse:collapse don't mix.

It can also be done with CSS, though it might involve a little more thinking . This may not be a real world layout, but I have seen pages that are similar. Consider this a riddle; an exercise to buff up your CSS skills. To make things a little more interesting, I have framed the question in a little 2 part web page called has_links . We will examine the code and the question: Layout with tables or CSS? , side-by-side, blow-by-blow, as our two opponents battle it out for code supremacy. Part I lays out how has_links came to be. I hope you enjoy. Part II is has_links . You might be surprised . Part II I was amazed at how quickly really good answers appeared mere minutes after I posted. It was a humbling experience. I have no desire to compete in time trials with you. BUT, all that being said, upon close examination of the solutions offered, I came to realize that none of the CSS solutions (including my own at the time) worked as well as either of the table solutions offered. The Challenge was all about CSS being better than tables for any layout solution. So I added 3 new rules (remember, one of the rules is that the rules can be changed). This annoyed some people. So then I added some colorful explanations about why the rules were changed. I think this annoyed them even more. Our garden is to have a fence around it; something to set it apart from whatever dreary surroundings it may find itself in; and not too expensive, but easy to keep clean. So I want a 1 pixel black border around the garden Inhabitants of each garden plot (the characters) must be either black or white, depending on which shows them the best in their garden. Also they are all of cursive descent. There are no italics amoung them. ;-) The garden is relocatable, that is, I can have this garden, anywhere on the page (no absolute positioning). This is what the final output is to look like (background color optional): My apologies for the capricious and last minute rule changes. I had it wrong. The inhabitants of each garden plot are artisans, hand crafted specialists. They are descendants of the cursive family , and owe their sense of style to the italics . The garden has to be relocatable because both kinds of gardens (table and CSS) need to coexist on the same page. I may be wrong to say that position:absolute rules are not allowed. If you can get them to work in this context, then more power to you. They will certainly be accepted. I asked for a fence around the plot because each garden type is going to be planted in a countryside with an orange background very similar to the color of the some of the flowers we grow. I live in Holland now, and the Tulip season is fast approaching. If you fly over Holland in the next few weeks, and it's a clear day (kind of rare here) the landscape below you will look rather similar to this silly exercise. I'm not crazy about orange but I do like and admire the Dutch, so that is why we have an orange background, a tribute to my host country. :-) Part III I have posted Ted's has_links from The Challenge below along with this image because the occupants can be easily added to the garden plots without touching the CSS rules - everything is automatically centered.

(thanks has_links , has_links ) You don't have to worry about your favorite username being taken already - you're the only one who uses your email address. (thanks has_links ) CONS User has more to type every time they log in. What if a user wants multiple accounts? They'll need another email address. (Do I even want a user to be able to create multiple accounts?) Easy for a potential attacker to guess (if they know the target's email address, they know the login id). (thanks has_links ) Users may be tempted to use the same password they use for their email account, which is bad security.

(thanks has_links ) A hacker could spam the registration form and use ""email already taken"" responses to generate a list of valid emails. (thanks has_links ) Not everyone has an email address. (thanks has_links ) If I went with email as id, I would provide a mechanism to allow it to be changed in the event a user changes address. In this case users would not be posting content to a public site, so a separate username won't be necessary to protect the email addresses (but it is something to consider for other sites).

Do you have any recommendations? Does anyone have experiences to share? FINAL EDIT Thank you all for your responses. I have decided to use email as an id, but then allow the creation of a username for login purposes after registration. This allows a little flexibility while keeping registration as short as possible.

That's basically it for now. I might have a few more questions coming up, but this has been bothering me for the last hour or so, and I can seem to find consistent guidance elsewhere.

Overall, the small overhead was worth it. Fast forward to 2009. There's a few groups out there now claiming to have C# linkers. (Jason Zander even said himself that it wouldn't take much to implement one.) Instead of the cute, dozen-so meg download of .NET 1.0, we now have a massive 200-300 mb cross-platform complete .NET 3.5 installer that contains versions of .NET for x86, x64, and ia64. Microsoft's suggestions to decrease the runtime size include: Unpack the redistributable, remove the target platforms you don't want, and put it back together Use the web bootstrapper that only downloads the libraries for your platform Use the Client Profile installer (new as of late 2008) which has limited libraries and only works for x86 To make matters worse, as I understand it (please correct me if I'm wrong) the client profile don't even register with windows as having .NET 3.5 installed. This means if multiple .NET 3.5 client applications are installed on the computer, none will see each other and the runtime will be re-installed again and again! I really don't know what Microsoft is thinking here. Even assuming the worst case install will be for one target platform (eg, x64) and only those libraries need to be included, you're still looking at upwards of 60 mb overhead on your app. Even one of the most well known .NET apps, Paint.NET, was fraught with has_links If THEY have problems distributing a free app, what about the rest of the world? In the end, they had to has_links before they could install their own application. So how about it. A linker.

I know several ways of doing it, but I'm wondering what the best way is (where ""best"" means clearest and/or shortest, not the most efficient. I have a list and I want to loop over it, printing each value. I want to print a comma between each item, but not after the last one (nor before the first one). List --> Item ( , Item ) * List --> ( Item , ) * Item Sample solution 1: boolean isFirst = true; for (Item i : list) { if (isFirst) { System.out.print(i); // no comma isFirst = false; } else { System.out.print("", ""+i); // comma } } Sample solution 2 - create a sublist: if (list.size()>0) { System.out.print(list.get(0)); // no comma List theRest = list.subList(1, list.size()); for (Item i : theRest) { System.out.print("", ""+i); // comma } } Sample solution 3: Iterator i = list.iterator(); if (i.hasNext()) { System.out.print(i.next()); while (i.hasNext()) System.out.print("", ""+i.next()); } These treat the first item specially; one could instead treat the last one specially. Incidentally, here is how List toString is implemented (it's inherited from AbstractCollection), in Java 1.6: public String toString() { Iterator i = iterator(); if (! i.hasNext()) return ""[]""; StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.append('['); for (;;) { E e = i.next(); sb.append(e == this ? ""(this Collection)"" : e); if (! i.hasNext()) return sb.append(']').toString(); sb.append("", ""); } } It exits the loop early to avoid the comma after the last item. BTW: this is the first time I recall seeing ""(this Collection)""; here's code to provoke it: List l = new LinkedList(); l.add(l); System.out.println(l); I welcome any solution, even if they use unexpected libraries (regexp?); and also solutions in languages other than Java (e.g. I think Python/Ruby have an intersperse function - how is that implemented?).

But it's possible that a given ""long-running"" command may finish earlier than the timeout. (Let's call it a ""typically-long-running-but-sometimes-fast"" command, or tlrbsf for fun.) So this nifty 1-liner approach has a couple of problems. First, the sleep isn't conditional, so that sets an undesirable lower bound on the time taken for the sequence to finish. Consider 30s or 2m or even 5m for the sleep, when the tlrbsf command finishes in 2 seconds — highly undesirable. Second, the kill is unconditional, so this sequence will attempt to kill a non-running process and whine about it. So... Is there a way to timeout a typically-long-running-but-sometimes-fast ( ""tlrbsf"" ) command that has a bash implementation (the other question already has Perl and C answers) will terminate at the earlier of the two: tlrbsf program termination, or timeout elapsed will not kill non-existing/non-running processes (or, optionally: will not complain about a bad kill) doesn't have to be a 1-liner can run under Cygwin or Linux ... and, for bonus points, runs the tlrbsf command in the foreground and any 'sleep' or extra process in the background, such that the stdin/stdout/stderr of the tlrbsf command can be redirected, same as if it had been run directly?

Specifically: How to manage build numbers systematically in a distributed development environment How to maintain version numbers in source / available to the runtime application How to properly integrate with source repository How to more automatically manage version numbers vs. repository tags How to integrate with continuous build infrastructure There are quite a number of tools available, and ant (the build system we're using) has a task that will maintain a build number, but it's not clear how to manage this with multiple, concurrent developers using CVS, svn, or similar. [EDIT] Several good and helpful partial or specific answers have appeared below, so I'll summarize a few of them. It sounds to me like there is not really a strong ""best practice"" on this, rather a collection of overlapping ideas. Below, find my summaries and some resulting questions that folks might try to answer as follow-ups. [New to stackoverflow... please provide comments if I'm doing this wrong.] If you are using SVN, versioning of a specific checkout comes along for the ride. Build numbering can exploit this to create a unique build number that identifies the specific checkout/revision. [CVS, which we are using for legacy reasons, doesn't provide quite this level of insight... manual intervention with tags gets you part way there.] If you are using maven as your build system, there is support for producing a version number from the SCM, as well as a release module for automatically producing releases. [We can't use maven, for a variety of reasons, but this helps those who can. [Thanks to has_links ]] If you are using has_links as your build system, the following task description can help produce a Java .properties file capturing build information, which can then be folded into your build in a number of ways. [We expanded on this idea to include hudson-derived information, thanks has_links ]. Ant and maven (and hudson and cruise control) provide easy means for getting build numbers into a .properties file, or into a .txt/.html file. Is this ""safe"" enough to keep it from being tampered with intentionally or accidentally? Is it better to compile it into a ""versioning"" class at build time? Assertion: Build numbering should be defined/enacted in a continuous integration system like has_links . [Thanks to has_links ] We have taken this suggestion, but it does crack open the release engineering question: How does a release happen? Are there multiple buildnumbers in a release? Is there a meaningful relationship between buildnumbers from differing releases? Question: What is the objective behind a build number? Is it used for QA? How? Is it used primarily by developers to disambiguate between multiple builds during development, or more for QA to determine what build an end-user got? If the goal is reproducibility, in theory this is what a release version number should provide -- why doesn't it? (please answer this as a part of your answers below, it will help illuminate the choices you have made/suggested...) Question: Is there a place for build numbers in manual builds? Is this so problematic that EVERYONE should be using a CI solution? Question: Should build numbers be checked in to the SCM? If the goal is reliably and unambiguously identifying a particular build, how to cope with a variety of continuous or manual build systems that may crash/restart/etc... Question: Should a build number be short and sweet (i.e., monotonically increasing integer) so that it's easy to stick into file names for archival, easy to refer to in communication, etc... or should it be long and full of usernames, datestamps, machine names, etc? Question: Please provide details about how the assignment of build numbers fits into your larger automated release process. Yes, maven lovers, we know this is done and done, but not all of us have drunk the kool-aid quite yet... I'd really like to flesh this out into a complete answer, at least for the concrete example of our cvs/ant/hudson setup, so someone could build a complete strategy based on this question. I'll mark as ""The Answer"" anyone who can give a soup-to-nuts description for this particular case (including cvs tagging scheme, relevant CI config items, and release procedure that folds the build number into the release such that it's programmatically accessible.) If you want to ask/answer for another particular configuration (say, svn/maven/cruise control) I'll link to the question from here. --JA [EDIT 23 Oct 09] I accepted the top-voted answer because I think it's a reasonable solution, while several of the other answers also include good ideas. If someone wants to take a crack at synthesizing some of these with has_links 's, I'll consider accepting a different one. The only concern I have with marty-lamb's is that it doesn't produce a reliably serialized build number -- it depends on a local clock at the builder's system to provide unambiguous build numbers, which isn't great. [Edit Jul 10] We now include a class like the below. This allows the version numbers to be compiled into the final executable.

Tools like Catwalk and the web console are invaluable to me. But with TurboGears 2 coming out which brings WSGI support, and after reading up on the religious debates between the Django and WSGI camps, I'm really torn between ""doing it the right way"" , e.g., learning WSGI, spending valuable time writing functionality that already exists in Django and other full-stack frameworks, as opposed to using Django or some high-level framework that does everything for me.

(IMO) So, I guess my question is, which is the better choice, or is it just a matter of opinion, and should I suck it up and use Django if it achieves what I want with minimal fuss (I want authentication and a CRUD interface to my database)? I tried Werkzeug, Glashammer, and friends, but AuthKit and Repoze scared me off, as well as the number of steps involved to just setup basic authentication.

2055,728434.0,66.0,14168.0,"Background I am using interface-based programming on a current project and have run into a problem when overloading operators (specifically the Equality and Inequality operators). Assumptions I'm using C# 3.0, .NET 3.5 and Visual Studio 2008 UPDATE - The Following Assumption was False! Requiring all comparisons to use Equals rather than operator== is not a viable solution, especially when passing your types to libraries (such as Collections). The reason I was concerned about requiring Equals to be used rather than operator== is that I could not find anywhere in the .NET guidelines that it stated it would use Equals rather than operator== or even suggest it. However, after re-reading has_links I have found this: By default, the operator == tests for reference equality by determining whether two references indicate the same object. Therefore, reference types do not have to implement operator == in order to gain this functionality. When a type is immutable, that is, the data that is contained in the instance cannot be changed, overloading operator == to compare value equality instead of reference equality can be useful because, as immutable objects, they can be considered the same as long as they have the same value. It is not a good idea to override operator == in non-immutable types. and this has_links The IEquatable interface is used by generic collection objects such as Dictionary, List, and LinkedList when testing for equality in such methods as Contains, IndexOf, LastIndexOf, and Remove. It should be implemented for any object that might be stored in a generic collection. Contraints Any solution must not require casting the objects from their interfaces to their concrete types. Problem When ever both sides of the operator== are an interface, no operator== overload method signature from the underlying concrete types will match and thus the default Object operator== method will be called. When overloading an operator on a class, at least one of the parameters of the binary operator must be the containing type, otherwise a compiler error is generated (Error BC33021 has_links ) It's not possible to specify implementation on an interface See Code and Output below demonstrating the issue. Question How do you provide proper operator overloads for your classes when using interface-base programming? References has_links For predefined value types, the equality operator (==) returns true if the values of its operands are equal, false otherwise. For reference types other than string, == returns true if its two operands refer to the same object. For the string type, == compares the values of the strings. See Also Code using System; namespace OperatorOverloadsWithInterfaces { public interface IAddress : IEquatable { string StreetName { get; set; } string City { get; set; } string State { get; set; } } public class Address : IAddress { private string _streetName; private string _city; private string _state; public Address(string city, string state, string streetName) { City = city; State = state; StreetName = streetName; } #region IAddress Members public virtual string StreetName { get { return _streetName; } set { _streetName = value; } } public virtual string City { get { return _city; } set { _city = value; } } public virtual string State { get { return _state; } set { _state = value; } } public static bool operator ==(Address lhs, Address rhs) { Console.WriteLine(""Address operator== overload called.""); // If both sides of the argument are the same instance or null, they are equal if (Object.ReferenceEquals(lhs, rhs)) { return true; } return lhs.Equals(rhs); } public static bool operator !=(Address lhs, Address rhs) { return !(lhs == rhs); } public override bool Equals(object obj) { // Use 'as' rather than a cast to get a null rather an exception // if the object isn't convertible Address address = obj as Address; return this.Equals(address); } public override int GetHashCode() { string composite = StreetName + City + State; return composite.GetHashCode(); } #endregion #region IEquatable Members public virtual bool Equals(IAddress other) { // Per MSDN documentation, x.Equals(null) should return false if ((object)other == null) { return false; } return ((this.City == other.City) && (this.State == other.State) && (this.StreetName == other.StreetName)); } #endregion } public class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { IAddress address1 = new Address(""seattle"", ""washington"", ""Awesome St""); IAddress address2 = new Address(""seattle"", ""washington"", ""Awesome St""); functionThatComparesAddresses(address1, address2); Console.Read(); } public static void functionThatComparesAddresses(IAddress address1, IAddress address2) { if (address1 == address2) { Console.WriteLine(""Equal with the interfaces.""); } if ((Address)address1 == address2) { Console.WriteLine(""Equal with Left-hand side cast.""); } if (address1 == (Address)address2) { Console.WriteLine(""Equal with Right-hand side cast.""); } if ((Address)address1 == (Address)address2) { Console.WriteLine(""Equal with both sides cast.""); } } } } Output Address operator== overload called Equal with both sides cast.",Operator Overloading with Interface-Based Programming in C#,2.0,3.0,728511.0,2233.0,2009-04-08 03:32:13,<c#><.net><operator-overloading><equals>,,1.0,7979.0

2119,786383.0,187.0,62096.0,"I frequently hear/read the following advice: Always make a copy of an event before you check it for null and fire it. This will eliminate a potential problem with threading where the event becomes null at the location right between where you check for null and where you fire the event: // Copy the event delegate before checking/calling EventHandler copy = TheEvent; if (copy != null) copy(this, EventArgs.Empty); // Call any handlers on the copied list Updated : I thought from reading about optimizations that this might also require the event member to be volatile, but Jon Skeet states in his answer that the CLR doesn't optimize away the copy. But meanwhile, in order for this issue to even occur, another thread must have done something like this: // Better delist from event - don't want our handler called from now on: otherObject.TheEvent -= OnTheEvent; // Good, now we can be certain that OnTheEvent will not run... The actual sequence might be this mixture: // Copy the event delegate before checking/calling EventHandler copy = TheEvent; // Better delist from event - don't want our handler called from now on: otherObject.TheEvent -= OnTheEvent; // Good, now we can be certain that OnTheEvent will not run... if (copy != null) copy(this, EventArgs.Empty); // Call any handlers on the copied list The point being that OnTheEvent runs after the author has unsubscribed, and yet they just unsubscribed specifically to avoid that happening. Surely what is really needed is a custom event implementation with appropriate synchronisation in the add and remove accessors. And in addition there is the problem of possible deadlocks if a lock is held while an event is fired. So is this has_links ? It seems that way - a lot of people must be taking this step to protect their code from multiple threads, when in reality it seems to me that events require much more care than this before they can be used as part of a multi-threaded design. Consequently, people who are not taking that additional care might as well ignore this advice - it simply isn't an issue for single-threaded programs, and in fact, given the absence of volatile in most online example code, the advice may be having no effect at all. (And isn't it a lot simpler to just assign the empty delegate { } on the member declaration so that you never need to check for null in the first place?) Updated: In case it wasn't clear, I did grasp the intention of the advice - to avoid a null reference exception under all circumstances. My point is that this particular null reference exception can only occur if another thread is delisting from the event, and the only reason for doing that is to ensure that no further calls will be received via that event, which clearly is NOT achieved by this technique. You'd be concealing a race condition - it would be better to reveal it! That null exception helps to detect an abuse of your component. If you want your component to be protected from abuse, you could follow the example of WPF - store the thread ID in your constructor and then throw an exception if another thread tries to interact directly with your component. Or else implement a truly thread-safe component (not an easy task). So I contend that merely doing this copy/check idiom is cargo cult programming, adding mess and noise to your code. To actually protect against other threads requires a lot more work. Update in response to Eric Lippert's blog posts: So there's a major thing I'd missed about event handlers: ""event handlers are required to be robust in the face of being called even after the event has been unsubscribed"", and obviously therefore we only need to care about the possibility of the event delegate being null . Is that requirement on event handlers documented anywhere? And so: ""There are other ways to solve this problem; for example, initializing the handler to have an empty action that is never removed. But doing a null check is the standard pattern."" So the one remaining fragment of my question is, why is explicit-null-check the ""standard pattern""? The alternative, assigning the empty delegate, requires only = delegate {} to be added to the event declaration, and this eliminates those little piles of stinky ceremony from every place where the event is raised. It would be easy to make sure that the empty delegate is cheap to instantiate. Or am I still missing something?

2146,810409.0,61.0,19228.0,"I'm going to be teaching a lower-division course in discrete structures. I have selected the text book has_links in part because it contains examples and concepts that are conducive to implementation with a functional programming language. (I also think it's a good textbook.) I want an easy-to-understand FP language to illustrate DS concepts and that the students can use. Most students will have had only one or two semesters of programming in Java, at best. After looking at Scheme, Erlang, Haskell, Ocaml, and SML, I've settled on either Haskell or Standard ML. I'm leaning towards Haskell for the reasons outlined below, but I'd like the opinion of those who are active programmers in one or the other. Both Haskell and SML have pattern matching which makes describing a recursive algorithm a cinch. Haskell has nice list comprehensions that match nicely with the way such lists are expressed mathematically. Haskell has lazy evaluation. Great for constructing infinite lists using the list comprehension technique. SML has a truly interactive interpreter in which functions can be both defined and used. In Haskell, functions must be defined in a separate file and compiled before being used in the interactive shell. SML gives explicit confirmation of the function argument and return types in a syntax that's easy to understand. For example: val foo = fn : int * int -> int. Haskell's implicit curry syntax is a bit more obtuse, but not totally alien. For example: foo :: Int -> Int -> Int. Haskell uses arbitrary-precision integers by default. It's an external library in SML/NJ. And SML/NJ truncates output to 70 characters by default. Haskell's lambda syntax is subtle -- it uses a single backslash. SML is more explicit. Not sure if we'll ever need lambda in this class, though. Essentially, SML and Haskell are roughly equivalent. I lean toward Haskell because I'm loving the list comprehensions and infinite lists in Haskell. But I'm worried that the extensive number of symbols in Haskell's compact syntax might cause students problems. From what I've gathered reading other posts on SO, Haskell is not recommended for beginners starting out with FP. But we're not going to be building full-fledged applications, just trying out simple algorithms. What do you think? Edit: Upon reading some of your great responses, I should clarify some of my bullet points. In SML, there's no syntactic distinction between defining a function in the interpreter and defining it in an external file. Let's say you want to write the factorial function. In Haskell you can put this definition into a file and load it into GHCi: fac 0 = 1 fac n = n * fac (n-1) To me, that's clear, succinct, and matches the mathematical definition in the book. But if you want to write the function in GHCi directly, you have to use a different syntax: let fac 0 = 1; fac n = n * fac (n-1) When working with interactive interpreters, from a teaching perspective it's very, very handy when the student can use the same code in both a file and the command line. By ""explicit confirmation of the function,"" I meant that upon defining the function, SML right away tells you the name of the function, the types of the arguments, and the return type. In Haskell you have to use the :type command and then you get the somewhat confusing curry notation. One more cool thing about Haskell--this is a valid function definition: fac 0 = 1 fac (n+1) = (n+1) * fac n Again, this matches a definition they might find in the textbook.

My goal is to inspire students that programming is cool . We know that programming is cool because you can create anything you imagine - it's the ultimate creative outlet. I want to inspire these beginners and get them over as many early-learning humps as I can. Now, my reasons are selfish. I'm teaching an Intro to Computing course to a group of 60 half-engineering, half business majors; all freshmen. They are the students who came from underprivileged High schools. From my past experience, the group is generally split as follows: a few has_links , some who try very hard and kind of get it, the few who try very hard and barely get it, and the few who don't care. I want to reach as many of these groups as effectively as I can. Here's an example of how I'd use a computer program to teach: Here's an example of what I'm looking for: a 1-line VBS script to get your computer to talk to you: CreateObject(""sapi.spvoice"").Speak InputBox(""Enter your text"",""Talk it"") I could use this to demonstrate order of operations. I'd show the code, let them play with it, then explain that There's a lot going on in that line, but the computer can make sense of it, because it knows the rules. Then I'd show them something like this: 4(5*5) / 10 + 9(.25 + .75) And you can see that first I need to do is (5*5). Then I can multiply for 4. And now I've created the Object. Dividing by 10 is the same as calling Speak - I can't Speak before I have an object, and I can't divide before I have 100. Then on the other side I first create an InputBox with some instructions for how to display it. When I hit enter on the input box it evaluates or ""returns"" whatever I entered. (Hint: 'oooooo' makes a funny sound) So when I say Speak, the right side is what to Speak. And I get that from the InputBox. So when you do several things on a line, like: x = 14 + y; You need to be aware of the order of things. First we add 14 and y. Then we put the result (what it evaluates to, or returns) into x. That's my goal, to have a bunch of these cool examples to demonstrate and teach the class while they have fun. I tried this example on my roommate and while I may not use this as the first lesson, she liked it and learned something.

That said, Question: What database model, technique, or pattern should be used to deal with ""classes"" of attributes describing e-commerce products which can be changed at run time? In a good E-commerce database, you will store classes of options (like TV resolution then have a resolution for each TV, but the next product may not be a TV and not have ""TV resolution""). How do you store them, search efficiently, and allow your users to setup product types with variable fields describing their products? If the search engine finds that customers typically search for TVs based on console depth, you could add console depth to your fields, then add a single depth for each tv product type at run time. There is a nice common feature among good e-commerce apps where they show a set of products, then have ""drill down"" side menus where you can see ""TV Resolution"" as a header, and the top five most common TV Resolutions for the found set. You click one and it only shows TVs of that resolution, allowing you to further drill down by selecting other categories on the side menu. These options would be the dynamic product attributes added at run time.

By reading stuff here and there I gathered that the common process is: formulate your Ajax call using some has_links library (e.g., has_links ), set up a URL pattern in Django that catches the call and passes it to a view function in the has_links view function retrieve the objects you are interested in and send them back to the client in JSON format or similar (by using the built in serializer module, or has_links ) define a callback function in JavaScript that receives the JSON data and parses them, so to create whatever HTML is needed to be displayed. Finally, the JavaScript script puts the HTML wherever it should stay. Now, what I still don't get is how are Django templates related to all of this? Apparently, we're not making use of the power of templates at all. Ideally, I thought it'd be nice to pass back a JSON object and a template name, so that the data could be iterated over and an HTML block is created. But maybe I'm totally wrong here... The only resource I found that goes in this direction is has_links but I haven't tried it yet. Obviously, what's going to happen in this case is that all the resulting HTML is created on the server side, then passed to the client. The JavaScript-callback function only has to display it in the right place. Does this cause performance problems? If not, even without using the snippet above, why not formatting the HTML directly in the backend using Python instead of the front-end? Many thanks!

2229,891643.0,597.0,75518.0,"If a picture's worth 1000 words, how much of a picture can you fit in 140 characters? Note : That's it folks! Bounty deadline is here, and after some tough deliberation, I have decided that has_links just barely edged out has_links . I will post more detailed notes once I've had a chance to write them up. Of course, everyone should feel free to continue to submit solutions and improve solutions for people to vote on. Thank you to everyone who submitted and entry; I enjoyed all of them. This has been a lot of fun for me to run, and I hope it's been fun for both the entrants and the spectators. I came across has_links about trying to compress images into a Twitter comment, and lots of people in that thread (and a has_links ) had suggestions about different ways you could do it. So, I figure it would make a good coding challenge; let people put their money where their mouth is, and show how their ideas about encoding can lead to more detail in the limited space that you have available. I challenge you to come up with a general purpose system for encoding images into 140 character Twitter messages, and decoding them into an image again. You can use Unicode characters, so you get more than 8 bits per character. Even allowing for Unicode characters, however, you will need to compress images into a very small amount of space; this will certainly be a lossy compression, and so there will have to be subjective judgements about how good each result looks. Here is the result that the original author, has_links , got from his encoding (image is licensed under a has_links ): Can you do better? Rules Your program must have two modes: encoding and decoding . When encoding : Your program must take as input a graphic in any reasonable raster graphic format of your choice. We'll say that any raster format supported by has_links counts as reasonable. Your program must output a message which can be represented in 140 or fewer Unicode code points; 140 code points in the range U+0000 – U+10FFFF , excluding non-characters ( U+FFFE , U+FFFF , U+ n FFFE , U+ n FFFF where n is 1 – 10 hexadecimal, and the range U+FDD0 – U+FDEF ) and surrogate code points ( U+D800 – U+DFFF ). It may be output in any reasonable encoding of your choice; any encoding supported by has_links will be considered reasonable, and your platform native encoding or locale encoding would likely be a good choice. See Unicode notes below for more details. When decoding : Your program should take as input the output of your encoding mode. Your program must output an image in any reasonable format of your choice, as defined above, though for output vector formats are OK as well. The image output should be an approximation of the input image; the closer you can get to the input image, the better. The decoding process may have no access to any other output of the encoding process other than the output specified above; that is, you can't upload the image somewhere and output the URL for the decoding process to download, or anything silly like that. For the sake of consistency in user interface, your program must behave as follows: Your program must be a script that can be set to executable on a platform with the appropriate interpreter, or a program that can be compiled into an executable. Your program must take as its first argument either encode or decode to set the mode. Your program must take input in one or more of the following ways (if you implement the one that takes file names, you may also read and write from stdin and stdout if file names are missing): Take input from standard in and produce output on standard out. my-program encode output.txt my-program decode output.png Take input from a file named in the second argument, and produce output in the file named in the third. my-program encode input.png output.txt my-program decode output.txt output.png For your solution, please post: Your code, in full, and/or a link to it hosted elsewhere (if it's very long, or requires many files to compile, or something). An explanation of how it works, if it's not immediately obvious from the code or if the code is long and people will be interested in a summary. An example image, with the original image, the text it compresses down to, and the decoded image. If you are building on an idea that someone else had, please attribute them. It's OK to try to do a refinement of someone else's idea, but you must attribute them. Guidelines These are basically rules that may be broken, suggestions, or scoring criteria: Aesthetics are important. I'll be judging, and suggest that other people judge, based on: How good the output image looks, and how much it looks like the original. How nice the text looks. Completely random gobbledigook is OK if you have a really clever compression scheme, but I also want to see answers that turn images into mutli-lingual poems, or something clever like that. Note that the author of the original solution decided to use only Chinese characters, since it looked nicer that way. Interesting code and clever algorithms are always good. I like short, to the point, and clear code, but really clever complicated algorithms are OK too as long as they produce good results. Speed is also important, though not as important as how good a job compressing the image you do. I'd rather have a program that can convert an image in a tenth of a second than something that will be running genetic algorithms for days on end. I will prefer shorter solutions to longer ones, as long as they are reasonably comparable in quality; conciseness is a virtue. Your program should be implemented in a language that has a freely-available implementation on Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows. I'd like to be able to run the programs, but if you have a great solution that only runs under has_links or something, that's fine. Your program should be as general as possible; it should work for as many different images as possible, though some may produce better results than others. In particular: Having a few images built into the program that it matches and writes a reference to, and then produces the matching image upon decoding, is fairly lame and will only cover a few images. A program that can take images of simple, flat, geometric shapes and decompose them into some vector primitive is pretty nifty, but if it fails on images beyond a certain complexity it is probably insufficiently general. A program that can only take images of a particular fixed aspect ratio but does a good job with them would also be OK, but not ideal. You may find that a black and white image can get more information into a smaller space than a color image. On the other hand, that may limit the types of image it's applicable to; faces come out fine in black and white, but abstract designs may not fare so well. It is perfectly fine if the output image is smaller than the input, while being roughly the same proportion. It's OK if you have to scale the image up to compare it to the original; what's important is how it looks. Your program should produce output that could actually go through Twitter and come out unscathed. This is only a guideline rather than a rule, since I couldn't find any documentation on the precise set of characters supported, but you should probably avoid control characters, funky invisible combining characters, private use characters, and the like. Scoring rubric As a general guide to how I will be ranking solutions when choosing my accepted solution, lets say that I'll probably be evaluating solutions on a 25 point scale (this is very rough, and I won't be scoring anything directly, just using this as a basic guideline): 15 points for how well the encoding scheme reproduces a wide range of input images. This is a subjective, aesthetic judgement 0 means that it doesn't work at all, it gives the same image back every time, or something 5 means that it can encode a few images, though the decoded version looks ugly and it may not work at all on more complicated images 10 means that it works on a wide range of images, and produces pleasant looking images which may occasionally be distinguishable 15 means that it produces perfect replicas of some images, and even for larger and more complex images, gives something that is recognizable. Or, perhaps it does not make images that are quite recognizable, but produces beautiful images that are clearly derived from the original. 3 points for clever use of the Unicode character set 0 points for simply using the entire set of allowed characters 1 point for using a limited set of characters that are safe for transfer over Twitter or in a wider variety of situations 2 points for using a thematic subset of characters, such as only Han ideographs or only right-to-left characters 3 points for doing something really neat, like generating readable text or using characters that look like the image in question 3 points for clever algorithmic approaches and code style 0 points for something that is 1000 lines of code only to scale the image down, treat it as 1 bit per pixel, and base64 encode that 1 point for something that uses a standard encoding technique and is well written and brief 2 points for something that introduces a relatively novel encoding technique, or that is surprisingly short and clean 3 points for a one liner that actually produces good results, or something that breaks new ground in graphics encoding (if this seems like a low number of points for breaking new ground, remember that a result this good will likely have a high score for aesthetics as well) 2 points for speed. All else being equal, faster is better, but the above criteria are all more important than speed 1 point for running on free (open source) software, because I prefer free software (note that C# will still be eligible for this point as long as it runs on Mono, likewise MATLAB code would be eligible if it runs on GNU Octave) 1 point for actually following all of the rules. These rules have gotten a bit big and complicated, so I'll probably accept otherwise good answers that get one small detail wrong, but I will give an extra point to any solution that does actually follow all of the rules Reference images Some folks have asked for some reference images. Here are a few reference images that you can try; smaller versions are embedded here, they all link to larger versions of the image if you need those: has_links has_links has_links has_links Prize I am offering a 500 rep bounty (plus the 50 that StackOverflow kicks in) for the solution that I like the best, based on the above criteria. Of course, I encourage everyone else to vote on their favorite solutions here as well. Note on deadline This contest will run until the bounty runs out, about 6 PM on Saturday, May 30. I can't say the precise time it will end; it may be anywhere from 5 to 7 PM. I will guarantee that I'll look at all entries submitted by 2 PM, and I will do my best to look at all entries submitted by 4 PM; if solutions are submitted after that, I may not have a chance to give them a fair look before I have to make my decision. Also, the earlier you submit, the more chance you will have for voting to be able to help me pick the best solution, so try and submit earlier rather than right at the deadline. Unicode notes There has also been some confusion on exactly what Unicode characters are allowed. The range of possible Unicode code points is U+0000 to U+10FFFF . There are some code points which are never valid to use as Unicode characters in any open interchange of data; these are the noncharacters and the surrogate code points . Noncharacters are defined in the has_links as the values U+FFFE , U+FFFF , U+ n FFFE , U+ n FFFF where n is 1 – 10 hexadecimal, and the range U+FDD0 – U+FDEF . These values are intended to be used for application-specific internal usage, and conforming applications may strip these characters out of text processed by them. Surrogate code points, defined in the has_links as U+D800 – U+DFFF , are used for encoding characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane in UTF-16; thus, it is impossible to represent these code points directly in the UTF-16 encoding, and it is invalid to encode them in any other encoding. Thus, for the purpose of this contest, I will allow any program which encodes images into a sequence of no more than 140 Unicode code points from the range U+0000 – U+10FFFF , excluding all noncharacters and surrogate pairs as defined above. I will prefer solutions that use only assigned characters, and even better ones that use clever subsets of assigned characters or do something interesting with the character set they use. For a list of assigned characters, see the has_links ; note that some characters are listed directly, while some are listed only as the start and end of a range. Also note that surrogate code points are listed in the database, but forbidden as mentioned above. If you would like to take advantage of certain properties of characters for making the text you output more interesting, there are a has_links available, such as a has_links and has_links . Since Twitter does not specify the exact character set they support, I will be lenient about solutions which do not actually work with Twitter because certain characters count extra or certain characters are stripped. It is preferred but not required that all encoded outputs should be able to be transferred unharmed via Twitter or another microblogging service such as has_links . I have seen some documentation stating that Twitter entity-encodes <, >, and &, and thus counts those as 4, 4, and 5 characters respectively, but I have not tested that out myself, and their JavaScript character counter doesn't seem to count them that way. Tips & Links The definition of valid Unicode characters in the rules is a bit complicated. Choosing a single block of characters, such as CJK Unified Ideographs (U+4E00–U+9FCF) may be easier. You may use existing image libraries, like has_links or has_links , for your image manipulation. If you need some help understanding the Unicode character set and its various encodings, see has_links or has_links . The earlier you get your solution in, the more time I (and other people voting) will have to look at it. You can edit your solution if you improve it; I'll base my bounty on the most recent version when I take my last look through the solutions. If you want an easy image format to parse and write (and don't want to just use an existing format), I'd suggest using the has_links . It's a text based format that's very easy to work with, and you can use has_links to convert to and from it.

2236,895901.0,57.0,16338.0,"We are using the excellent has_links to deal with unhandled exceptions in an ASP.NET 3.5 web application. This works extremely well for all of the site apart from WCF services which are being consumed using the REST features. When an exception occurs within the operation methods that is not handled by the application code, WCF handles it in various ways depending on the service contracts and configuration settings. This means that the exception does not end up firing the ASP.NET HttpApplication.Error event that has_links uses. The two solutions I am aware of to deal with this are: Wrap all method calls in a try { } catch(Exception ex) { Elmah.ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(ex); throw; } to explicitly call Elmah within the catch block. Use has_links as described in has_links blog post has_links to factor out the call to ELMAH to a separate ErrorHandler. The first option is extremely simple but is not exactly has_links .

We have two sides in the discussion: Me and some others that say we should always use parameters to safeguard against sql injections and the other guys that don't think it is necessary. Instead they want to replace single apostrophes with two apostrophes in all strings to avoid sql injections. Our databases are all running Sql Server 2005 or 2008 and our code base is running on .NET framework 2.0. Let me give you a simple example in C#: I want us to use this: string sql = ""SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name=@name""; SqlCommand getUser = new SqlCommand(sql, connection); getUser.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@name"", userName); //... blabla - do something here, this is safe While the other guys want to do this: string sql = ""SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name="" + SafeDBString(name); SqlCommand getUser = new SqlCommand(sql, connection); //... blabla - are we safe now? Where the SafeDBString function is defined as follows: string SafeDBString(string inputValue) { return ""'"" + inputValue.Replace(""'"", ""''"") + ""'""; } Now, as long as we use SafeDBString on all string values in our queries we should be safe. Right? There are two reasons to use the SafeDBString function. First, it is the way it has been done since the stone ages, and second, it is easier to debug the sql statements since you see the excact query that is run on the database. So then. My question is whether it really is enough to use the SafeDBString function to avoid sql injection attacks. I have been trying to find examples of code that breaks this safety measure, but I can't find any examples of it. Is there anybody out there that can break this? How would you do it? EDIT: To summarize the replies so far: Nobody has found a way to get around the SafeDBString on Sql Server 2005 or 2008 yet. That is good, I think? Several replies pointed out that you get a performance gain when using parametrized queries. The reason is that the query plans can be reused. We also agree that using parametrized queries give more readable code that is easier to maintain Further it is easier to always use parameters than to use various versions of SafeDBString, string to number conversions and string to date conversions. Using parameters you get automatic type conversion, something that is especially useful when we are working with dates or decimal numbers. And finally: has_links as JulianR wrote. The database vendors spend lots of time and money on security. There is no way we can do better and no reason we should try to do their job. So while nobody was able to break the simple security of the SafeDBString function I got lots of other good arguments.

Main question: Is this as inefficient as it sounds? Should its use be limited to one-off initializations? (And of course showing off!) Second question: The new HashSet must be the ""this"" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism? Third question: Is this idiom too obscure to use in production code? Summary: Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. On question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though I'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it). On question (1), the generated code should run quickly. The extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @Thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases. Question (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. If I understand the answers, what's happening in DBI is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a ""this"" value referencing the instance being constructed. Very neat. Overall, DBI strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity. Coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with Arrays.asList, varargs methods, Google Collections, and the proposed Java 7 Collection literals. Newer JVM languages like Scala, JRuby, and Groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with Java. Given that DBI clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, I'd probably shy away from it.

2259,924472.0,97.0,23977.0,"I'm interested in exposing a direct REST interface to collections of JSON documents (think has_links or has_links ). The problem I'm running into is how to handle the GET operation on the collection root if the collection is large. As an example pretend I'm exposing StackOverflow's Questions table where each row is exposed as a document (not that there necessarily is such a table, just a concrete example of a sizable collection of 'documents'). The collection would be made available at /db/questions with the usual CRUD api GET /db/questions/XXX , PUT /db/questions/XXX , POST /db/questions is in play. The standard way to get the entire collection is to GET /db/questions but if that naively dumps each row as a JSON object, you'll get a rather sizeable download and a lot of work on the part of the server. The solution is, of course, paging. Dojo has solved this problem in its has_links via a clever RFC2616-compliant extension of using the Range header with a custom range unit items . The result is a 206 Partial Content that returns only the requested range. The advantage of this approach over a query parameter is that it leaves the query string for...queries (e.g. GET /db/questions/?score>200 or somesuch, and yes that'd be encoded %3E ). This approach completely covers the behavior I want. The problem is that has_links specifies that on a 206 response (emphasis mine): The request MUST have included a Range header field ( has_links ) indicating the desired range, and MAY have included an If-Range header field ( has_links ) to make the request conditional. This makes sense in the context of the standard usage of the header but is a problem because I'd like the 206 response to be the default to handle naive clients/random people exploring. I've gone over the RFC in detail looking for a solution but have been unhappy with my solutions and am interested in SO's take on the problem. Ideas I've had: Return 200 with a Content-Range header! - I don't think that this is wrong, but I'd prefer if a more obvious indicator that the response is only Partial Content. Return 400 Range Required - There is not a special 400 response code for required headers, so the default error has to be used and read by hand. This also makes exploration via web browser (or some other client like Resty) more difficult. Use a query parameter - The standard approach, but I'm hoping to allow queries a la Persevere and this cuts into the query namespace. Just return 206 ! - I think most clients wouldn't freak out, but I'd rather not go against a MUST in the RFC Extend the spec! Return 266 Partial Content - Behaves exactly like 206 but is in response to a request that MUST NOT contain the Range header. I figure that 266 is high enough that I shouldn't run into collision issues and it makes sense to me but I'm not clear on whether this is considered taboo or not.

My Solution I've now posted my C# solution has_links (403 chars). Update: has_links has beaten the old one significantly at 294 chars , with the help of a bit of lovely regex! I suspected that this will get easily beaten by some of the languages out there with lighter syntax (particularly the funcional/dynamic ones), and have been proved right, but I'd be curious if someone could beat this in C# still. Update I've seen some very crafty solutions already. Thanks to everyone who has posted one. Although I haven't tested any of them yet, I'm going to trust people and assume they at least work with all of the given examples. Just for the note, re-entrancy (i.e. thread-safety) is not a requirement for the function, though it is a bonus.

I like Kate better, but the refresh system is very annoying (it doesn't use inotify, rather, maybe a 10s polling interval). The reason I don't use the built-in text editor is because broken auto-complete functionalities cause the IDE to hang for maybe 10s. rebuild only modified files The Eclipse build system is broken.

Welcome my fellow UIScrollView hackers. I have a UIScrollView with paging enabled, and I'm displaying UIImageViews like the built-in photos app. (Does this sound familiar yet?) I found the following project on github: has_links Which shows how to implement zooming in a scroll view while paging is enabled. If anyone else tries this out, I actually had to remove the UIScrollView subclass and use the native class otherwise it doesn't work. I think it's because of changes in the 3.0 SDK relating to how the scroll view intercepts touch events. So the the idea is to remove all the other views when you start zooming, and move the current view to (0, 0) in the scrollview , updating the contentsize etc. Then when you zoom back to 1.0f it adds the other views back and puts things all back in order. Anyway, that project works perfectly in the simulator, but on the device there is some nasty movement of the view you are resizing, which looks like it's caused by the fact we are changing the contentsize / offset etc. for the view being resized. You have to do this view moving otherwise you can pan left through the whitespace left by the other views. I found one interesting note in the ""Known Issues"" of the has_links : UIScrollView: After zooming, content inset is ignored and content is left in the wrong position. This kind of sounds like what is happening here. After zooming in, the view will shift offscreen because you have changed the offset etc. I've spent hours on this already and I'm slowing coming to the sad realization that this just isn't going to work. Three20's photo viewer is out of the question: it's too heavy weight and there is too much unnecessary UI and other behaviour. The built in Photo app seems to do some magic. If you zoom in on an image and pan to the far edges, the current photo moves independently of the photo next to it which isn't what you get when trying this with a standard UIScrollView . I've seen discussion about nesting the UIScrollView 's but I really don't want to go there. Has anybody managed this with the standard UIScrollView (and works in the 2.2 and 3.0 SDK)?

I have now just recently tried SvcTraceViewer.exe. I managed to catch one exception on the client end. I see that its duration is 1 minute. Looking at the server side trace, I can see that the server is not aware of this exception. The maximum duration I can see is 10 seconds. I have looked at active database connections using exec sp_who on the server. I only have a few (2-3). I have looked at TCP connections from one client using TCPview. It usually is around 2-3 and I have seen up to 5 or 6. Simply put, I am stumped. I have tried everything I could find, and must be missing something very simple that a WCF expert would be able to see. It is my gut feeling that something is blocking my clients at the low-level (TCP), before the server actually receives the message and/or that something is queuing the messages at the server level and never letting them process. If you have any performance counters I should look at, please let me know. (please indicate what values are bad, as some of these counters are hard to decypher). Also, how could I log the WCF message size? Finally, are there any tools our there that would allow me to test how many connections I can establish between my client and server (independently from my application) Thanks for your time! Extra information added June 20th: My WCF application does something similar to the following. while (true) { Step1GetConfigurationSettingsFromServerViaWCF(); // can change between calls Step2GetWorkUnitFromServerViaWCF(); DoWorkLocally(); // takes 5-15minutes. Step3SendBackResultsToServerViaWCF(); } Using WireShark, I did see that when the error occurs, I have a five TCP retransmissions followed by a TCP reset later on. My guess is the RST is coming from WCF killing the connection. The exception report I get is from Step3 timing out. I discovered this by looking at the tcp stream ""tcp.stream eq 192"". I then expanded my filter to ""tcp.stream eq 192 and http and http.request.method eq POST"" and saw 6 POSTs during this stream. This seemed odd, so I checked with another stream such as tcp.stream eq 100. I had three POSTs, which seems a bit more normal because I am doing three calls. However, I do close my connection after every WCF call, so I would have expected one call per stream (but I don't know much about TCP). Investigating a bit more, I dumped the http packet load to disk to look at what these six calls where. 1) Step3 2) Step1 3) Step2 4) Step3 - corrupted 5) Step1 6) Step2 My guess is two concurrent clients are using the same connection, that is why I saw duplicates. However, I still have a few more issues that I can't comprehend: a) Why is the packet corrupted? Random network fluke - maybe? The load is gzipped using this sample code: has_links - Could the code be buggy once in a while when used concurrently? I should test without the gzip library. b) Why would I see step 1 & step 2 running AFTER the corrupted operation timed out? It seems to me as if these operations should not have occurred. Maybe I am not looking at the right stream because my understanding of TCP is flawed. I have other streams that occur at the same time. I should investigate other streams - a quick glance at streams 190-194 show that the Step3 POST have proper payload data (not corrupted).

The formatter must be stand-alone, that is, it must support a ""batch"" mode that is has_links . Ideally, it should be independent of any particular operating system as well. So, a built-in formatter for the IDE du jour is of little interest here (unless that IDE supports batch mode formatter invocation, perhaps from the command line). A formatter written in closed-source C/C++ that only runs on, say, Windows is not ideal, but is somewhat interesting. To be clear, a ""formatter"" (or ""beautifier"") is not the same as a ""style checker."" A formatter accepts source code as input, applies styling rules, and produces styled source code that is semantically equivalent to the original source code. Syntactic modifications are limited to things like modifying code layout as in changing whitespace, or organizing import statements. Very little, if any, other refactoring is performed. A style checker also applies styling rules, but it simply reports rule violations without producing modified source code as output. So the picture looks like this: Formatter (produces modified source code that conforms to styling rules) Read Source Code → Apply Styling Rules → Write Styled Source Code Style Checker (does not produce modified source code) Read Source Code → Apply Styling Rules → Write Rule Violations Further Clarifications Solutions must be highly configurable.

As the has_links says, Many aspects of the behavior of this method are inherently platform-dependent: The rename operation might not be able to move a file from one filesystem to another, it might not be atomic, and it might not succeed if a file with the destination abstract pathname already exists. The return value should always be checked to make sure that the rename operation was successful. In my case, as part of an upgrade procedure, I need to move (rename) a directory that may contain gigabytes of data (lots of subdirectories and files of varying sizes). The move is always done within the same partition/drive, so there's no real need to physically move all the files on disk. There shouldn't be any file locks to the contents of the dir to be moved, but still, quite often, renameTo() fails to do its job and returns false. (I'm just guessing that perhaps some file locks expire somewhat arbitrarily on Windows.) Currently I have a fallback method that uses copying & deleting, but this sucks because it may take a lot of time, depending on the size of the folder. I'm also considering simply documenting the fact that the user can move the folder manually to avoid waiting for hours, potentially.

It works well and behaves exactly like the original css method with one exception: if 0 args are passed, it returns the computed style object.

In this case, Animal is quite similar to a Java interface, as it contains only a pure virtual method. makeSpeak does not know the nature of the Animal it gets passed. It just sends it the signal “speak” and leaves the late binding to take care of which method to call: either Cat::speak() or Dog::speak(). This means that, as far as makeSpeak is concerned, the knowledge of which subclass is actually passed is irrelevant. But what about Python? Let’s see the code for the same case in Python. Please note that I try to be as similar as possible to the C++ case for a moment: class Animal(object): def speak(self): raise NotImplementedError() class Dog(Animal): def speak(self): print ""woff!"" class Cat(Animal): def speak(self): print ""meow"" def makeSpeak(a): a.speak() d=Dog() c=Cat() makeSpeak(d) makeSpeak(c) Now, in this example you see the same strategy. You use inheritance to leverage the hierarchical concept of both Dogs and Cats being Animals. But in Python, there’s no need for this hierarchy. This works equally well class Dog: def speak(self): print ""woff!"" class Cat: def speak(self): print ""meow"" def makeSpeak(a): a.speak() d=Dog() c=Cat() makeSpeak(d) makeSpeak(c) In Python you can send the signal “speak” to any object you want. If the object is able to deal with it, it will be executed, otherwise it will raise an exception. Suppose you add a class Airplane to both codes, and submit an Airplane object to makeSpeak. In the C++ case, it won’t compile, as Airplane is not a derived class of Animal. In the Python case, it will raise an exception at runtime, which could even be an expected behavior. On the other side, suppose you add a MouthOfTruth class with a method speak(). In the C++ case, either you will have to refactor your hierarchy, or you will have to define a different makeSpeak method to accept MouthOfTruth objects, or in java you could extract the behavior into a CanSpeakIface and implement the interface for each. There are many solutions... What I’d like to point out is that I haven’t found a single reason yet to use inheritance in Python (apart of frameworks and trees of exceptions, but I guess that alternative strategies exist). you don’t need to implement a base-derived hierarchy to perform polymorphically. If you want to use inheritance to reuse implementation, you can accomplish the same through containment and delegation, with the added benefit that you can alter it at runtime, and you clearly define the interface of the contained, without risking unintended side effects. So, in the end, the question stands: what's the point of inheritance in Python? Edit : thanks for the very interesting answers. Indeed you can use it for code reuse, but I am always careful when reusing implementation. In general, I tend to do very shallow inheritance trees or no tree at all, and if a functionality is common I refactor it out as a common module routine and then call it from each object. I do see the advantage of having one single point of change (eg. instead of adding to Dog, Cat, Moose and so on, I just add to Animal, which is the basic advantage of inheritance), but you can achieve the same with a delegation chain (eg. a la JavaScript).

I was under the impression that a div is simply a block element with auto width. In the following code shouldn't the div and the input have identical dimensions? How do I get the input to fill the width. 100% width won't work because the input has padding and a border (causing a final width of 1px + 5px + 100% + 5px + 1px). Fixed widths aren't an option, I'm looking for something more flexible. I'd prefer a direct answer to a workaround, this seems like a CSS quirk and understanding it may be useful later. width:auto div, input { border: 1px solid red; height: 5px; padding: 5px; } input, form { display: block; width: auto; } EDIT: I should point out I can already do this with wrapper workarounds. Apart from this screwing with the page semantics and CSS selector relationships I'm trying to understand the nature of the problem and whether it can be overcome by changing the nature of the INPUT itself. EDIT 2: Ok, this is TRULY strange! I've found that the solution is to simply add max-width:100% to an input with width:100%;padding:5px; . However this raises even more questions (which i'll ask in a seperate question) but it seems that width uses the normal CSS box model and max-width uses the IE border-box model. How very odd. EDIT 3: Ok, that last one appears to be a bug in FF3. IE8 and Safari4 limit the max-width to 100% + padding + border which is what the spec says to do. Finally, IE got something right.

The list of colors is often presented as if it has special properties that render them immune to dithering.

2391,1046016.0,89.0,7880.0,"I fully realize that what I am proposing does not follow the .NET guidelines, and, therefore, is probably a poor idea for this reason alone. However, I would like to consider this from two possible perspectives: (1) Should I consider using this for my own development work, which is 100% for internal purposes. (2) Is this a concept that the framework designers could consider changing or updating? I am thinking about using an event signature that utilizes a strong typed 'sender', instead of typing it as 'object', which is the current .NET design pattern. That is, instead of using a standard event signature that looks like this: class Publisher { public event EventHandler SomeEvent; } I am considering using an event signature that utilizes a strong-typed 'sender' parameter, as follows: First, define a ""StrongTypedEventHandler"": [SerializableAttribute] public delegate void StrongTypedEventHandler( TSender sender, TEventArgs e ) where TEventArgs : EventArgs; This is not all that different from an Action, but by making use of the StrongTypedEventHandler , we enforce that the TEventArgs derives from System.EventArgs . Next, as an example, we can make use of the StrongTypedEventHandler in a publishing class as follows: class Publisher { public event StrongTypedEventHandler SomeEvent; protected void OnSomeEvent() { if (SomeEvent != null) { SomeEvent(this, new PublisherEventArgs(...)); } } } The above arrangement would enable subscribers to utilize a strong-typed event handler that did not require casting: class Subscriber { void SomeEventHandler(Publisher sender, PublisherEventArgs e) { if (sender.Name == ""John Smith"") { // ... } } } I do fully realize that this breaks with the standard .NET event-handling pattern; however, keep in mind that contravariance would enable a subscriber to use a traditional event handling signature if desired: class Subscriber { void SomeEventHandler(object sender, PublisherEventArgs e) { if (((Publisher)sender).Name == ""John Smith"") { // ... } } } That is, if an event handler needed to subscribe to events from disparate (or perhaps unknown) object types, the handler could type the 'sender' parameter as 'object' in order to handle the full breadth of potential sender objects. Other than breaking convention (which is something that I do not take lightly, believe me) I cannot think of any downsides to this. There may be some CLS compliance issues here. This does run in Visual Basic .NET 2008 100% fine (I've tested), but I believe that the older versions of Visual Basic .NET through 2005 do not have delegate covariance and contravariance. [Edit: I have since tested this, and it is confirmed: VB.NET 2005 and below cannot handle this, but VB.NET 2008 is 100% fine. See ""Edit #2"", below.] There may be other .NET languages that also have a problem with this, I can't be sure. But I do not see myself developing for any language other than C# or Visual Basic .NET, and I do not mind restricting it to C# and VB.NET for .NET Framework 3.0 and above. (I could not imagine going back to 2.0 at this point, to be honest.) Can anyone else think of a problem with this? Or does this simply break with convention so much that it makes people's stomachs turn? Here are some related links that I've found: (1) has_links (2) has_links (3) has_links I am interested in anyone's and everyone's opinion on this... Thanks in advance, Mike Edit #1: This is in response to has_links : Here's a full working example that shows that both strong-typed event handlers and the current standard event handlers that use a 'object sender' parameter can co-exist with this approach. You can copy-paste in the code and give it a run: namespace csScrap.GenericEventHandling { class PublisherEventArgs : EventArgs { // ... } [SerializableAttribute] public delegate void StrongTypedEventHandler( TSender sender, TEventArgs e ) where TEventArgs : EventArgs; class Publisher { public event StrongTypedEventHandler SomeEvent; public void OnSomeEvent() { if (SomeEvent != null) { SomeEvent(this, new PublisherEventArgs()); } } } class StrongTypedSubscriber { public void SomeEventHandler(Publisher sender, PublisherEventArgs e) { MessageBox.Show(""StrongTypedSubscriber.SomeEventHandler called.""); } } class TraditionalSubscriber { public void SomeEventHandler(object sender, PublisherEventArgs e) { MessageBox.Show(""TraditionalSubscriber.SomeEventHandler called.""); } } class Tester { public static void Main() { Publisher publisher = new Publisher(); StrongTypedSubscriber strongTypedSubscriber = new StrongTypedSubscriber(); TraditionalSubscriber traditionalSubscriber = new TraditionalSubscriber(); publisher.SomeEvent += strongTypedSubscriber.SomeEventHandler; publisher.SomeEvent += traditionalSubscriber.SomeEventHandler; publisher.OnSomeEvent(); } } } Edit #2: This is in response to has_links regarding covariance and contravariance and how it applies here. Delegates in the C# language have had covariance and contravariance for so long that it just feels ""intrinsic"", but it's not. It might even be something that is enabled in the CLR, I don't know, but Visual Basic .NET did not get covariance and contravariance capability for its delegates until the .NET Framework 3.0 (VB.NET 2008). And as a result, Visual Basic.NET for .NET 2.0 and below would not be able to utilize this approach. For example, the above example can be translated into VB.NET as follows: Namespace GenericEventHandling Class PublisherEventArgs Inherits EventArgs ' ... ' ... End Class _ Public Delegate Sub StrongTypedEventHandler(Of TSender, TEventArgs As EventArgs) _ (ByVal sender As TSender, ByVal e As TEventArgs) Class Publisher Public Event SomeEvent As StrongTypedEventHandler(Of Publisher, PublisherEventArgs) Public Sub OnSomeEvent() RaiseEvent SomeEvent(Me, New PublisherEventArgs) End Sub End Class Class StrongTypedSubscriber Public Sub SomeEventHandler(ByVal sender As Publisher, ByVal e As PublisherEventArgs) MessageBox.Show(""StrongTypedSubscriber.SomeEventHandler called."") End Sub End Class Class TraditionalSubscriber Public Sub SomeEventHandler(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As PublisherEventArgs) MessageBox.Show(""TraditionalSubscriber.SomeEventHandler called."") End Sub End Class Class Tester Public Shared Sub Main() Dim publisher As Publisher = New Publisher Dim strongTypedSubscriber As StrongTypedSubscriber = New StrongTypedSubscriber Dim traditionalSubscriber As TraditionalSubscriber = New TraditionalSubscriber AddHandler publisher.SomeEvent, AddressOf strongTypedSubscriber.SomeEventHandler AddHandler publisher.SomeEvent, AddressOf traditionalSubscriber.SomeEventHandler publisher.OnSomeEvent() End Sub End Class End Namespace VB.NET 2008 can run it 100% fine. But I've now tested it on VB.NET 2005, just to be sure, and it does not compile, stating: Method 'Public Sub SomeEventHandler(sender As Object, e As vbGenericEventHandling.GenericEventHandling.PublisherEventArgs)' does not have the same signature as delegate 'Delegate Sub StrongTypedEventHandler(Of TSender, TEventArgs As System.EventArgs)(sender As Publisher, e As PublisherEventArgs)' Basically, delegates are invariant in VB.NET versions 2005 and below. I actually thought of this idea a couple of years ago, but VB.NET's inability to deal with this bothered me... But I've now moved solidly to C#, and VB.NET can now handle it, so, well, hence this post. Edit: Update #3 Ok, I have been using this quite successfully for a while now. It really is a nice system. I decided to name my ""StrongTypedEventHandler"" as ""GenericEventHandler"", defined as follows: [SerializableAttribute] public delegate void GenericEventHandler( TSender sender, TEventArgs e ) where TEventArgs : EventArgs; Other than this renaming, I implemented it exactly as discussed above. It does trip over FxCop rule CA1009, which states: ""By convention, .NET events have two parameters that specify the event sender and event data. Event handler signatures should follow this form: void MyEventHandler( object sender, EventArgs e). The 'sender' parameter is always of type System.Object, even if it is possible to employ a more specific type. The 'e' parameter is always of type System.EventArgs. Events that do not provide event data should use the System.EventHandler delegate type. Event handlers return void so that they can send each event to multiple target methods. Any value returned by a target would be lost after the first call."" Of course, we know all this, and are breaking the rules anyway. (All event handlers can use the standard 'object Sender' in their signature if preferred in any case -- this is a non-breaking change.) So the use of a SuppressMessageAttribute does the trick: [SuppressMessage(""Microsoft.Design"", ""CA1009:DeclareEventHandlersCorrectly"", Justification = ""Using strong-typed GenericEventHandler event handler pattern."")] I hope that this approach becomes the standard at some point in the future. It really works very nicely. Thanks for all your opinions guys, I really appreciate it...

My problem is the large number (billions) of values in the sets I'm handling: Working in Python, I can't just make a list or hash with billions of elements.

Add the square of the value to sum_of_squares. Divide sum by count, storing as the variable mean. Divide sum_of_squares by count, storing as the variable mean_of_squares. Square mean, storing as square_of_mean. Subtract square_of_mean from mean_of_squares, storing as variance. Output mean and variance. This ""on-line"" algorithm has weaknesses (e.g., accuracy problems as sum_of_squares quickly grows larger than integer range or float precision), but it basically gives me what I need, without having to store every value in each set. But I don't know whether similar techniques exist for estimating the additional statistics (median, mode, skewness, kurtosis). I could live with a biased estimator, or even a method that compromises accuracy to a certain degree, as long as the memory required to process N values is substantially less than O(N).

The gist that I get is that when you have a parent entity (e.g. Parent) that has a collection of Child objects using a one-to-many mapping, setting inverse=true on the mapping tells Hibernate that 'the other side (the Child) has responsibility to update itself to maintain the foreign key reference in its table'. Doing this appears to have 2 benefits when it comes to adding Children to the collection in your code, and then saving the Parent (with cascade-all set): has_links (because without inverse set, Hibernate thinks it has two places to update the FK relationship), and according to the official docs: If the column of a association is declared NOT NULL, NHibernate may cause constraint violations when it creates or updates the association.

The rich comparison overloads are said to be preferred, but why is this so? Rich comparison operators are simpler to implement each, but you must implement several of them with nearly identical logic. However, if you can use the builtin cmp and tuple ordering, then __cmp__ gets quite simple and fulfills all the comparisons: class A(object): def __init__(self, name, age, other): self.name = name self.age = age self.other = other def __cmp__(self, other): assert isinstance(other, A) # assumption for this example return cmp((self.name, self.age, self.other), (other.name, other.age, other.other)) This simplicity seems to meet my needs much better than overloading all 6(!) of the rich comparisons. (However, you can get it down to ""just"" 4 if you rely on the ""swapped argument""/reflected behavior, but that results in a net increase of complication, in my humble opinion.) Are there any unforeseen pitfalls I need to be made aware of if I only overload __cmp__ ? I understand the < , <= , == , etc. operators can be overloaded for other purposes, and can return any object they like. I am not asking about the merits of that approach, but only about differences when using these operators for comparisons in the same sense that they mean for numbers.

You can read the article here: has_links I've recently taken over a project and after looking through their code, it's pretty awful.

The code is built as a website, has no separation of concerns, no unit testing, and code duplication everywhere. No Data layer, no real business logic, unless you count a bunch of classes in App_Code. I've made the recommendation to the stake holders that, while we should keep the existing code, and do bug fix releases, and some minor feature releases, we should start rewriting it immediately with Test Driven Development in mind and with clear separation of concerns. I'm thinking of going the ASP.NET MVC route. My only concern is of course, the length of time it might take to rewrite from scratch.

To make the problem tractable, all buildings are rectangular in shape and they share a common bottom (the city they are built in is very flat). The city is also viewed as two-dimensional. A building is specified by an ordered triple (Li, Hi, Ri) where Li and Ri are left and right coordinates, respectively, of building i and Hi is the height of the building. In the diagram below buildings are shown on the left with triples (1,11,5), (2,6,7), (3,13,9), (12,7,16), (14,3,25), (19,18,22), (23,13,29), (24,4,28) and the skyline, shown on the right, is represented by the sequence: 1, 11, 3, 13, 9, 0, 12, 7, 16, 3, 19, 18, 22, 3, 23, 13, 29, 0 The output should consist of the vector that describes the skyline as shown in the example above. In the skyline vector (v1, v2, v3, ... vn) , the vi such that i is an even number represent a horizontal line (height). The vi such that i is an odd number represent a vertical line (x-coordinate). The skyline vector should represent the ""path"" taken, for example, by a bug starting at the minimum x-coordinate and traveling horizontally and vertically over all the lines that define the skyline. Thus the last entry in the skyline vector will be a 0. The coordinates must be separated by a blank space.

Searching for this information yields fragmented information at best. I have learned that: RDLC reports do not store information about how to get data.

A feature of RDLC is that it can be run completely client-side in the ReportViewer control. This removes the need for a Reporting Services instance, and even removes the need for any database connection whatsoever, but: It adds the requirement that the data that is needed in the report has to be provided manually. Whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage depends on the particular application.

Can anyone suggest, when should I use Response.End() , when Response.Close() and when HttpContext.Current.ApplicationInstance.CompleteRequest() ? ref: has_links . Based on the input I've received, my answer is, Yes, Response.End is harmful , but it is useful in some limited cases. use Response.End() as an uncatchable throw, to immediately terminate the HttpResponse in exceptional conditions. Can be useful during debugging also. Avoid Response.End() to complete routine responses . use Response.Close() to immediately close the connection with the client. Per has_links , this method is not intended for normal HTTP request processing. It’s highly unlikely that you would have a good reason to call this method. use CompleteRequest() to end a normal request. CompleteRequest causes the ASP.NET pipeline to jump ahead to the EndRequest event, after the current HttpApplication event completes. So if you call CompleteRequest , then write something more to the response, the write will be sent to the client.

2460,1113611.0,264.0,103163.0,"There is a lot of discussions of Python vs Ruby, and I all find them completely unhelpful, because they all turn around why feature X sucks in language Y, or that claim language Y doesn't have X, although in fact it does. I also know exactly why I prefer Python, but that's also subjective, and wouldn't help anybody choosing, as they might not have the same tastes in development as I do. It would therefore be interesting to list the differences, objectively. So no ""Python's lambdas sucks"". Instead explain what Ruby's lambdas can do that Python's can't. No subjectivity. Example code is good! Don't have several differences in one answer, please. And vote up the ones you know are correct, and down those you know are incorrect (or are subjective). Also, differences in syntax is not interesting. We know Python does with indentation what Ruby does with brackets and ends, and that @ is called self in Python. UPDATE: This is now a community wiki, so we can add the big differences here. Ruby has a class reference in the class body In Ruby you have a reference to the class (self) already in the class body. In Python you don't have a reference to the class until after the class construction is finished. An example: class Kaka puts self end self in this case is the class, and this code would print out ""Kaka"". There is no way to print out the class name or in other ways access the class from the class definition body in Python (outside method definitions). All classes are mutable in Ruby This lets you develop extensions to core classes. Here's an example of a rails extension: class String def starts_with?(other) head = self[0, other.length] head == other end end Python (imagine there were no ''.startswith method): def starts_with(s, prefix): return s[:len(prefix)] == prefix You could use it on any sequence (not just strings). In order to use it you should import it explicitly e.g., from some_module import starts_with . Ruby has Perl-like scripting features Ruby has first class regexps, $-variables, the awk/perl line by line input loop and other features that make it more suited to writing small shell scripts that munge text files or act as glue code for other programs. Ruby has first class continuations Thanks to the callcc statement. In Python you can create continuations by various techniques, but there is no support built in to the language. Ruby has blocks With the ""do"" statement you can create a multi-line anonymous function in Ruby, which will be passed in as an argument into the method in front of do, and called from there. In Python you would instead do this either by passing a method or with generators. Ruby: amethod { |here| many=lines+of+code goes(here) } Python (Ruby blocks correspond to different constructs in Python): with amethod() as here: # `amethod() is a context manager many=lines+of+code goes(here) Or for here in amethod(): # `amethod()` is an iterable many=lines+of+code goes(here) Or def function(here): many=lines+of+code goes(here) amethod(function) # `function` is a callback Interestingly, the convenience statement in Ruby for calling a block is called ""yield"", which in Python will create a generator. Ruby: def themethod yield 5 end themethod do |foo| puts foo end Python: def themethod(): yield 5 for foo in themethod(): print foo Although the principles are different, the result is strikingly similar. Ruby supports functional style (pipe-like) programming more easily myList.map(&:description).reject(&:empty?).join(""\n"") Python: descriptions = (f.description() for f in mylist) ""\n"".join(filter(len, descriptions)) Python has built-in generators (which are used like Ruby blocks, as noted above) Python has support for generators in the language. In Ruby 1.8 you can use the generator module which uses continuations to create a generator from a block. Or, you could just use a block/proc/lambda! Moreover, in Ruby 1.9 Fibers are, and can be used as, generators, and the Enumerator class is a built-in generator has_links has_links has this generator example: def reverse(data): for index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1): yield data[index] Contrast this with the above block examples. Python has flexible name space handling In Ruby, when you import a file with require , all the things defined in that file will end up in your global namespace. This causes namespace pollution. The solution to that is Rubys modules. But if you create a namespace with a module, then you have to use that namespace to access the contained classes. In Python, the file is a module, and you can import its contained names with from themodule import * , thereby polluting the namespace if you want. But you can also import just selected names with from themodule import aname, another or you can simply import themodule and then access the names with themodule.aname . If you want more levels in your namespace you can have packages, which are directories with modules and an __init__.py file. Python has docstrings Docstrings are strings that are attached to modules, functions and methods and can be introspected at runtime. This helps for creating such things as the help command and automatic documentation. def frobnicate(bar): """"""frobnicate takes a bar and frobnicates it >>> bar = Bar() >>> bar.is_frobnicated() False >>> frobnicate(bar) >>> bar.is_frobnicated() True """""" Ruby's equivalent are similar to javadocs, and located above the method instead of within it. They can be retrieved at runtime from the files by using 1.9's Method#source_location has_links Python has multiple inheritance Ruby does not (""on purpose"" -- see Ruby's website, has_links ). It does reuse the module concept as a type of abstract classes. Python has list/dict comprehensions Python: res = [x*x for x in range(1, 10)] Ruby: res = (0..9).map { |x| x * x } Python: >>> (x*x for x in range(10)) at 0xb7c1ccd4> >>> list(_) [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] Ruby: p = proc { |x| x * x } (0..9).map(&p) Python 2.7+ : >>> {x:str(y*y) for x,y in {1:2, 3:4}.items()} {1: '4', 3: '16'} Ruby: >> Hash[{1=>2, 3=>4}.map{|x,y| [x,(y*y).to_s]}] => {1=>""4"", 3=>""16""} Python has decorators Things similar to decorators can also be created in Ruby, and it can also be argued that they aren't as necessary as in Python.

I've has_links that Vim completely replaces an IDE under Linux and while that's certainly true, it lacks one important feature: autocompletion. I know about Ctrl + N , has_links , has_links , has_links and has_links . Alas, none of these fits my description of “working autocompletion:” Ctrl + N works nicely (only) if you've forgotton how to spell class , or while . Oh well. Ctags gives you the rudiments but has a lot of drawbacks. Taglist is just a Ctags wrapper and as such, inherits most of its drawbacks (although it works well for listing declarations). cppcomplete simply doesn't work as promised, and I can't figure out what I did wrong, or if it's “working” correctly and the limitations are by design. OmniCppComplete seems to have the same problems as cppcomplete, i.e. auto-completion doesn't work properly. Additionally, the tags file once again needs to be updated manually. I'm aware of the fact that not even modern, full-blown IDEs offer good C++ code completion. That's why I've accepted Vim's lack in this area until now. But I think a fundamental level of code completion isn't too much to ask, and is in fact required for productive usage. So I'm searching for something that can accomplish at least the following things. Syntax awareness . cppcomplete promises (but doesn't deliver for me), correct, scope-aware auto-completion of the following: variableName.abc variableName->abc typeName::abc And really, anything else is completely useless. Configurability . I need to specify (easily) where the source files are, and hence where the script gets its auto-completion information from. In fact, I've got a Makefile in my directory which specifies the required include paths. Eclipse can interpret the information found therein, why not a Vim script as well? Up-to-dateness . As soon as I change something in my file, I want the auto-completion to reflect this. I do not want to manually trigger ctags (or something comparable). Also, changes should be incremental , i.e. when I've changed just one file it's completely unacceptable for ctags to re-parse the whole directory tree (which may be huge). Did I forget anything? Feel free to update. I'm comfortable with quite a lot of configuration and/or tinkering but I don't want to program a solution from scratch, and I'm not good at debugging Vim scripts. A final note, I'd really like something similar for Java and C# but I guess that's too much to hope for: ctags only parses code files and both Java and C# have huge, precompiled frameworks that would need to be indexed.

Obviously, this causes a lot of headaches. We're getting a lot better with our practices via our has_links platform and I'd really like to set it up to auto increment the values within the assemblyinfo.cs file so that the versions of our assemblies are auto updated with the code changes in that assembly. I had previously setup (before we found has_links ) a way to increment the value through either msbuild or the command line (can't remember), but with Hudson, that will update the SVN repository and trigger ANOTHER build. That would result in a slow infinite loop as Hudson polls SVN every hour. Is having Hudson increment the version number a bad idea? What would be an alternative way to do it? Ideally, my criteria for a solution would be one that: Increments the build number in assemblyinfo.cs before a build Only increments the build number in assemblies that have changed. This may not be possible as Hudson wipes out the project folder every time it does a build Commits the changed assemblyinfo.cs into the code repository (currently has_links ) Does not cause Hudson to trigger a new build the next time it scans for changes Working this out in my head, I could easily come up with a solution to most of this through batch files / commands, but all of my ideas would cause Hudson to trigger a new build the next time it scans.

2507,1164154.0,72.0,9230.0,"A large amount of what I thought I knew about REST is apparently wrong - and I'm not alone. This question has a long lead-in, but it seems to be necessary because the information is a bit scattered. The actual question comes at the end if you're already familiar with this topic. From the first paragraph of Roy Fielding's has_links , it's pretty clear he believes his work is being widely misinterpreted: I am getting frustrated by the number of people calling any HTTP-based interface a REST API. Today’s example is the has_links . That is RPC. It screams RPC. There is so much coupling on display that it should be given an X rating. Fielding goes on to list several attributes of a REST API. Some of them seem to go against both common practice and common advice on SO and other forums. For example: A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the API). ... A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an obvious coupling of client and server). ... A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application state, or in defining extended relation names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard media types. ... The idea of ""hypertext"" plays a central role - much more so than URI structure or what HTTP verbs mean. ""Hypertext"" is defined in one of the comments: When I [Fielding] say hypertext, I mean the simultaneous presentation of information and controls such that the information becomes the affordance through which the user (or automaton) obtains choices and selects actions. Hypermedia is just an expansion on what text means to include temporal anchors within a media stream; most researchers have dropped the distinction. Hypertext does not need to be HTML on a browser. Machines can follow links when they understand the data format and relationship types. I'm guessing at this point, but the first two points above seem to suggest that API documentation for a Foo resource that looks like the following leads to tight coupling between client and server and has no place in a RESTful system. GET /foos/{id} # read a Foo POST /foos/{id} # create a Foo PUT /foos/{id} # update a Foo Instead, an agent should be forced to discover the URIs for all Foos by, for example, issuing a GET request against /foos. (Those URIs may turn out to follow the pattern above, but that's beside the point.) The response uses a media type that is capable of conveying how to access each item and what can be done with it, giving rise to the third point above. For this reason, API documentation should focus on explaining how to interpret the hypertext contained in the response. Furthermore, every time a URI to a Foo resource is requested, the response contains all of the information needed for an agent to discover how to proceed by, for example, accessing associated and parent resources through their URIs, or by taking action after the creation/deletion of a resource. The key to the entire system is that the response consists of hypertext contained in a media type that itself conveys to the agent options for proceeding. It's not unlike the way a browser works for humans. But this is just my best guess at this particular moment. Fielding posted a has_links in which he responded to criticism that his discussion was too abstract, lacking in examples, and jargon-rich: Others will try to decipher what I have written in ways that are more direct or applicable to some practical concern of today. I probably won’t, because I am too busy grappling with the next topic, preparing for a conference, writing another standard, traveling to some distant place, or just doing the little things that let me feel I have I earned my paycheck. So, two simple questions for the REST experts out there with a practical mindset: how do you interpret what Fielding is saying and how do you put it into practice when documenting/implementing REST APIs? Edit: this question is an example of how hard it can be to learn something if you don't have a name for what you're talking about.

They're also often referred to as ""key/value stores"", and at base they act like giant distributed persistent hash tables. Specifically, I want to learn about the differences in conceptual data design with these new databases. What's easier, what's harder, what can't be done at all? Have you come up with alternate designs that work much better in the non-relational world? Have you hit your head against anything that seems impossible? Have you bridged the gap with any design patterns, e.g. to translate from one to the other? Do you even do explicit data models at all now (e.g. in UML) or have you chucked them entirely in favor of semi-structured / document-oriented data blobs? Do you miss any of the major extra services that RDBMSes provide, like relational integrity, arbitrarily complex transaction support, triggers, etc? I come from a SQL relational DB background, so normalization is in my blood. That said, I get the advantages of non-relational databases for simplicity and scaling, and my gut tells me that there has to be a richer overlap of design capabilities. What have you done?

""foo"" : throw S(); // 1 const char * p2 = x == 1 ? ""foo"" : f(); // 2 } The compilers had no problem with //1 but barfed on //2 because the the types in the conditional operator are different. So the type of a throw expression does not seem to be void. So what is it? If you answer, please back up your statements with quotes from the Standard.

But there are a lot of .el files, and I wonder if there is a way to compile them all with a simple command or something, to speed up the loading of Emacs. My Emacs is not always open, and I open and close it quite frequently, especially after I've set it up as a default editor for edit command in Total Commander to get used to it faster (yeah, windows xp here). My Emacs version is 22.3. And yes, the default Emacs installation without any customizations fires up instantly.

I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times less productive with Vim. The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are: Using alternatively left and right hands is the fastest way to use the keyboard. Never touching the mouse is the second way to be as fast as possible. It takes ages for you to move your hand, grab the mouse, move it, and bring it back to the keyboard (and you often have to look at the keyboard to be sure you returned your hand properly to the right place) Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim. Copy/Cut & paste. I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press Shift with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then Ctrl + C copies, you move the cursor and Ctrl + V pastes. With Vim it's horrible: yy to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!) [number xx]yy to copy xx lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do [number xx]dd then u to undo! Another example? Search & replace. In has_links : Ctrl + f then type what you want you search for, then press Enter . In Vim: / , then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put \ before each special character, then press Enter . And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.

This works great, since it avoids any external dependencies and the ""state"" of the database prior to running the tests (each of which are wrapped in a transaction which is rolled back) is well defined.

I'm wondering if there are any major advantages to creating a generic IRepository interface that all repositories implement, vs. each Repository having its own unique interface and set of methods. For example: a generic IRepository interface might look like (taken from has_links ): public interface IRepository : IDisposable { T[] GetAll(); T[] GetAll(Expression> filter); T GetSingle(Expression> filter); T GetSingle(Expression> filter, List>> subSelectors); void Delete(T entity); void Add(T entity); int SaveChanges(); DbTransaction BeginTransaction(); } Each Repository would implement this interface, for example: CustomerRepository:IRepository ProductRepository:IRepository etc. The alternate that we've followed in prior projects would be: public interface IInvoiceRepository : IDisposable { EntityCollection GetAllInvoices(int accountId); EntityCollection GetAllInvoices(DateTime theDate); InvoiceEntity GetSingleInvoice(int id, bool doFetchRelated); InvoiceEntity GetSingleInvoice(DateTime invoiceDate, int accountId); //unique InvoiceEntity CreateInvoice(); InvoiceLineEntity CreateInvoiceLine(); void SaveChanges(InvoiceEntity); //handles inserts or updates void DeleteInvoice(InvoiceEntity); void DeleteInvoiceLine(InvoiceLineEntity); } In the second case, the expressions (LINQ or otherwise) would be entirely contained in the Repository implementation, whoever is implementing the service just needs to know which repository function to call. I guess I don't see the advantage of writing all the expression syntax in the service class and passing to the repository. Wouldn't this mean easy-to-messup LINQ code is being duplicated in many cases? For example, in our old invoicing system, we call InvoiceRepository.GetSingleInvoice(DateTime invoiceDate, int accountId) from a few different services (Customer, Invoice, Account, etc). That seems much cleaner than writing the following in multiple places: rep.GetSingle(x => x.AccountId = someId && x.InvoiceDate = someDate.Date); The only disadvantage I see to using the specific approach is that we could end up with many permutations of Get* functions, but this still seems preferable to pushing the expression logic up into the Service classes.

Please try to keep it focused on Objective-C - my one bias I'll put forth is that Objective-C is Objective-C, so your preference that it be like Java or JavaScript aren't valid. Valid commentary is to do with technical issues (operation ordering, cast precedence, performance, etc), clarity (structure vs. object nature, both pro and con!), succinctness, etc. Note, I'm of the school of rigorous quality and readability in code having worked on huge projects where code convention and quality is paramount (the write once read a thousand times paradigm).",Dot notation vs. message notation for declared properties,19.0,2.0,1249479.0,149062.0,2009-08-08 17:14:15,<objective-c><syntax><coding-style>,,1.0,1081.0

The leaf nodes of a clustered index contain the data pages. A nonclustered index is a special type of index in which the logical order of the index does not match the physical stored order of the rows on disk.

2575,1251666.0,106.0,16422.0,"Let me first say that I have quite a lot of Java experience, but have only recently become interested in functional languages. Recently I've started looking at Scala, which seems like a very nice language. However, I've been reading about Scala's Actor framework in has_links , and there's one thing I don't understand. In chapter 30.4 it says that using react instead of receive makes it possible to re-use threads, which is good for performance, since threads are expensive in the JVM. Does this mean that, as long as I remember to call react instead of receive , I can start as many Actors as I like? Before discovering Scala, I've been playing with Erlang, and the author of has_links boasts about spawning over 200,000 processes without breaking a sweat. I'd hate to do that with Java threads. What kind of limits am I looking at in Scala as compared to Erlang (and Java)? Also, how does this thread re-use work in Scala? Let's assume, for simplicity, that I have only one thread. Will all the actors that I start run sequentially in this thread, or will some sort of task-switching take place? For example, if I start two actors that ping-pong messages to each other, will I risk deadlock if they're started in the same thread? According to Programming in Scala , writing actors to use react is more difficult than with receive . This sounds plausible, since react doesn't return. However, the book goes on to show how you can put a react inside a loop using Actor.loop . As a result, you get loop { react { ... } } which, to me, seems pretty similar to while (true) { receive { ... } } which is used earlier in the book. Still, the book says that ""in practice, programs will need at least a few receive 's"". So what am I missing here? What can receive do that react cannot, besides return? And why do I care? Finally, coming to the core of what I don't understand: the book keeps mentioning how using react makes it possible to discard the call stack to re-use the thread. How does that work? Why is it necessary to discard the call stack? And why can the call stack be discarded when a function terminates by throwing an exception ( react ), but not when it terminates by returning ( receive )? I have the impression that Programming in Scala has been glossing over some of the key issues here, which is a shame, because otherwise it's a truly excellent book.",Scala actors: receive vs react,5.0,1.0,1251716.0,127863.0,2009-08-09 16:14:14,<scala><multithreading><actor>,,1.0,3027.0
