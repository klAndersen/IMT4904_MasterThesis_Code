# IMT4904 MasterThesis - Singular features vs. unprocessed comparison

The files in this folder only contains questions that has at least 1 occurence of the feature in question. 
This is to run a comparison against the unprocessed, since in some cases, 
comparing 163 questions against 20.000 is obviously not going to have any impact.
'\_UP\_' indicates that this is the unprocessed data set.
