0,48295,-14,1096,"First, what is the proper terminology for a ""string"" in TeX/LaTeX that is an argument for a macro? e.g., \macro{somestring} Obviously somestring is a token, set of tokens, string, argument, etc. I will call it a string since I do not know what else to call it. I'm not thinking it is another macro but sort of ""inert"" text. What I want to be able to do is parse a string that represents macros in LaTeX but codified in a very simple way: The best way to describe it is to give an example The follow string x4y3[cgreen, t4[-3,4,a90]] represents setting properties x-position = 4 y-position = 3 color = green test = 4 with x offset -3, y offset 4 and angle 90 [ ] = optional (optional list of optional specifiers in no particular order) It should be VERY self explanatory how I went from the condensed string to the properties it represents. If not stare at the string for a few hours. You should be able to read the string and tell exactly what it means after knowing what the indicator symbols are. (this is no different than what xparse does with it's specification string except mine is a little more complex) Now the hard part, I want to be able to parse that string into a series of macros that set data. As you can probably guess it, the string represents something to do with placing a graphic at a location. If you want to have some interpretation for x4y3[cgreen, t4[-3,4,a90]] to make you feel better: Place a green circle at coordinates(4,3) with a piece of text ""4"" offset (-3,4) from it and rotated 90 degrees. To do this cleanly and efficiently I would like to create macros that are called for each corresponding macro in the string \def\x#1{} \def\y#1{} \def\c#1{} \def\t#1#2{} So we could see the string as simply calling \x{-3}\y{4}\c{green}\t{4}{-3,4,a90} So as you can see the string is just a ""condensed"" version of a macro. The string simply is a command value pair with possible optional arguments. One could almost simply go in and add \' s and brackets to get the command. For example, pseudo-code: parse_string{ foreach token in command-list write '\'token'{'next_token'}' } But I would like to add commands/macros that have more than one character (the smallest token size would take precedence) AND do other things like default values. Anyways, as usual this is relatively straightforward in most procedural programming languages but I'm sure I'll spend the next few weeks trying to figure out how to do it in TeX/LaTeX and then 10k lines of code later I'll probably end up with a buggy as hell version.",Stringified commands to macros sequence,2,12,48320.0,11637.0,2012-03-16 20:29:53,<macros><parsing><xparse>,2014-06-21 23:52:42,-1,3203

36,451,95,16576,"I'm quite happy hacking TeX macros and cobbling together bits and pieces from different style files to suit my own ends, but I have a suspicion that my resulting hacks are not quite as elegant as they could be. In particular, with regard to when to expand and when not to expand macros. A common occurrence for me is defining a meta-command that defines a whole slew of sub-commands. So the names of the sub-commands will contain parameters depending on the parameter passed to the meta-command, and the contents of the sub-commands will also vary a little depending on what the meta-command got. Often it won't be a direct substitution but rather a ""if #1 is 'a' do \this else do \that"", but \this and \that need expansion at define time, not call time. Here's a very simple example just involving direct substitution: \def\cohtheory#1{ \expandafter\newcommand\expandafter{\csname #1func\endcsname}[1][*]{% \MakeUppercase{#1}^{##1}} } Sometimes I worry that my commands are more complicated than they need be.

Using the geometry package and experimenting with its settings might look like an obvious idea, but it doesn't seem to be easy to preserve the original layout (unless you manually re-set textheight, textwidth, etc.). For backwards-compatibility, I'd prefer to have a solution that works both with pdflatex and with latex + dvips + ps2pdf; in particular, I'd prefer to not add any special command line switches on dvips command line for specifying the non-standard paper size. And I'd like to have a somewhat robust solution that I can use not only with standard class files such as article and amsart but also with publisher-specific styles. 2. What are the best practices to follow if I'm not lazy? If I'm willing to re-do the layout, are there any guidelines of recommended font sizes, fonts, page dimensions, aspect ratios, margin sizes, etc., that I should follow? Do we perhaps have a Latex document class or a package that produces an ebook-friendly layout?","Preparing PDF files for ebook readers, etc.",10,7,3074.0,100.0,2010-09-14 14:10:32,<pdf><margins><ebook>,,1,1962

148,9961,75,6022,"(Strictly speaking, this is a question about XeLaTeX and the xcolor package but I’m assuming that the issue is actually with the color model of PDF.) I’m having the problem that colours in my PDF don’t match. For example, I screen grabbed a colour value as RGB, declared it in my document and the resulting colour was completely different. To illustrate: Both colours were grabbed off the screen – on the left, from the PDF generated by XeLaTeX. On the right, the original colour whose RGB value I tried using in LaTeX (in case my issue isn’t clear: the colours on top are differnt, yet they have the same HSB values). So I thought that perhaps RGB doesn’t map without loss to whatever colour model PDF used and tried the obvious alternative – CMYK, which, after all, is often used in print (right?). Again, the colours are off, but now less perceptibly. Another example (this time using CMYK values): The colour is supposed to have the CMYK value (0.94, 0.63, 0.04, 0.07). I have declared the colour in my code as follows: \definecolor{primary}{cmyk}{0.94,0.63,0.04,0.07} The bottom half of the picture is created by TikZ. The top half is actually an EPS that I included via includegraphics . The EPS was created in Inkscape. Neither of the above colours has the correct CMYK value when examined with a colour picker: The top is (0.96, 0.67, 0.08, 0.19). The bottom is (0.92, 0.61, 0.06, 0.09). (Incidentally, when I try to enter the “correct” CMYK value in Inkscape, it “auto-corrects” my value to some other value. Wut?) Now, this mightn’t seem like a TeX related question at all. But, long story short, How can I reliably reproduce colours in pdfLaTeX/XeLaTeX? I know that the issue is confounded by the fact that PNG (which is the format of the above screenshots) uses an own colour model and so the screen shots may look different on your PC than on mine.

My impression is that TeX ( etc. ) is essentially a pile of undocumented macros (where even are functions? ) in an unparsable syntax (I am told it's Turing-complete), that very often collapses (most error messages have a mysterious origin), with shaky support for modern frameworks (I have to read a paper on font naming schemes to find how to apply Helvetica?), and no serious opportunity for actual programming (as opposed to braindead markup), with a confusingly fragmented codebase (which binary, distribution, library should I use, and how do they interact?). Given that the Big Idea is a laudable one, and that TeX and friends are far from an ideal implementation of it, I'd like to know: Why it is that, within the problem domain of programmatic document formatting, TeX is the only serious player? Does no-one have an idea of how do to this better? What would TeX look like if we were to design it from scratch?

However, I get confused when I meet the phrase 'double spacing' and setspace package. The question is, which dimension is doubled? Is it \baselineskip , or the skip between bottom and top of the two lines (something like \lineskip ), or some dimension else? I read the article about has_links in Wikipedia. It seems that the original meaning of leading is \lineskip . In Bringhurst's book ( The Elements Of Typographic Style ), \baselineskip is called a basic leading, total leading, while \lineskip is the added leading, but they are never doubled. In LaTeX, the basic total leading is the second argument of \fontsize , which is set to \baselineskip . For example, normal font size is 10pt with 12pt of \baselineskip . So, does double spacing mean \linespread{2} ? Or it implies a 10pt + 2x(12pt-2pt) = 14pt of TeX's \baselineskip , say, \linespread{1.16667} ? Microsoft Word tells me it should be the former. 'Double' line spacing means \linespread{2} in LaTeX. (In word, font size 10pt, single spacing gets 12pt baseline skip; double spacing gets 24pt) setspace.sty tells me both are wrong. \doublespacing is defined as \setstretch{1.667} . (The value is slightly changed to fit different \baselinespace ) That is to say, 'double spacing' means the baseline skip is double length of font size . (1.667x12pt = 20pt = 2x10pt.) Why? (Using setspace , font size 10pt, \singlespacing gets 12pt baseline skip; \doublespacing gets 20pt) The more I read, the more confused I get.

I have a large image for a thesis on an image processing topic, and I want show the large image, with zoomed in boxes (typically with the same aspect ratio). I also want colored frames overlaid on the large image to show what portions I'm magnifying. Here's an example: I am currently accomplishing this by taking the large image and copying the desired zoomed areas into seperate images, and creating the overlaid frames, all in MATLAB. I then use the technique discussed in this has_links of mine to align all the images nicely. My new question is, can a similar end product be created entirely within LaTeX so that the only external file I need is the original large image, and some LaTeX component (I'm thinking Tikz, but open to suggestions) creates the overlaid frames and cropped/ zoomed copies of it, then either arranges them as shown in my example, or uses the technique has_links to align them nicely. Also, the example I showed is just a sample layout; ideally any solution would be flexible enough to allow rearrangement to some other reasonable arrangement, such as large image on top (full linewidth) with two or three zoom boxes in a horizontal line under it. Thanks. The image I'm working with is here: Update Please see Jake's response below for current best/ complete version of code. The only outstanding item is that, while subcaptions work and can be referenced with \subref{} , the spy library processes the labels multiple times, resulting in a warning about multiply defined labels. As such, I have elected to not use subcaptions/ labels for now since the color-coding makes pretty clear the relationship between the zoomed images and the large one.

214,29840,99,4685,"When working with large documents, or even across multiple (smaller) documents, I often find that I forget which typographical consistencies I should stick to. With TeX being inherently consistent in the way it does things, most things are kept organized without the user even knowing about it. Additionally, using a customized documentclass (like has_links , for example) or packages (like has_links and has_links , to name two) improves on this consistency by user's choice. Sometimes, however, you are left to your own devices and have to do things manually. Of course, the latter could also stem from not knowing that a package exists to do the job for you, or because you'd rather have more control over the placement/use of a certain things without having it automated or globally set. To this extent, I though this would be a good place to ask the question: ""Which tools/techniques do you use to maintain consistency within your document?"" Sure, the question sounds broad. Many answers are scattered across this site and elsewhere (like the has_links or Bringhurst's has_links ).

The contents of has_links has some very relevant manual application of consistencies, including: Put a tilde before references or citations, e.g., Jie~\cite{habit06} . Differentiate between text comma and math comma, e.g., type for $x=a$, $b$, or~$c$ instead of for $x=a,b$, or $c$ . Write ellipsis using \ldots instead of three dots.

Ideally, I'd just specify a series of points, and TikZ would calculate the extra data itself to draw a nice series of curves passing smoothly through these points, perhaps with an optional ""looseness"" parameter that I could specify. But the only way I can find to draw nice curves is by explicitly giving control points, or by manually specifying in and out angles. I can think up a simple algorithm to do this, which would certainly be within TikZ's power to perform: just choose the in and out angles in a simple fashion based on the relative angles between each adjacent pair of line segments. Is something like this already built-in? Or can someone cook something up that does the job? Edit: Jake has provided an answer using the plot [smooth] functionality. This is almost perfect! But it can't do what I need, because it doesn't let me specify tangent angles manually where needed, which is especially important at the beginning and end of the curve. I would have thought this would be a natural and straightforward addition to the existing plot [smooth] algorithm: for every coordinate, an optional angle should be able to be specified as an argument, which if supplied is treated as the tangent angle for the curve at that point.

227,34830,55,11599,"I have gotten into the habit of using \ensuremath around math components in every macro that I define, so that I can use the same macro inside and outside of math mode. But egreg's comments in has_links has me thinking that perhaps I should not be doing this all the time: It's not a good idea, in my opinion, to add \ensuremath ; why should it be? Disclaimer: this is part of my \ensuremath -only-when-really-needed campaign. :) - has_links A related comment in has_links : Why \ensuremath ? Wouldn't $\scriptstyle#1$ be easier to read? - has_links In this case it was required to use math mode as we were within a \makebox (i.e., text mode). So, out of habit I used \ensuremath but egreg was right that in this case using $...$ would have worked just as well and was certainly easier to read. But, even in this case I still prefer to use \ensuremath so that it is more obvious that this can be used in math and text mode without having to think about \makebox being in text mode. So, is there really any harm in always using \ensuremath , at least for any of my personal macros? I realize that there is a slight extra overhead in processing, but is there something else to consider? If there are other considerations when they macros are coming packages that are intended for general purpose use, I would be interested in those as well. The most obvious one is that we may want to make sure that the user of the macro knows that this macro requires math mode, so require them to only use the macro in math mode. Since this references egreg's campaign, I felt I should include a has_links for new users as per my MWE-as-often-as-possible campaign: \documentclass{article} \newcommand{\FunctionF}{\ensuremath{x^2}}% \begin{document} Text mode: \FunctionF Math mode: $G(x) = x^3 - \FunctionF$ \end{document}",When not to use \ensuremath for math macro?,4,3,34837.0,4301.0,2011-11-14 18:06:46,<math-mode><macros><best-practices>,,1,2806
228,35039,57,1284,"TeX's macro processor does its work in a process called expansion . For an input stream of tokens, the macro processor repeatedly expands them until non-expandable tokens remain. The resulting stream of non-expandable tokens is passed to the TeX's execution processor. The process of expansion can be viewed as calling a function that expands to its result. Macros absorb their arguments from the input stream and expand to their replacement text, with arguments in-place. Other types of tokens can be expanded differently: for example, conditionals test their arguments (possibly expanding them, too) and skip the branch for which the condition is false. But there are also non-trivial tokens that are not expandable: most notably, \def and (not actually a token, but see below) register assignments. This means that they can't be used in a macro to obtain a result through expansion: they will be just passed through untouched. For example, \edef\test{\def\a{x}\a} will fail with ! Undefined control sequence. , because \def was not expanded and then \a was examined, which proved to be undefined. Likewise, \newcount\count \edef\test{\count=1} \showthe\count will show 0 , not 1 , because, again, none of \count=1 were expandable. One can imagine a system where such operations are expandable. More precisely, expanding \def would absorb a control sequence name, parameter text and replacement text from the input stream, define the new macro and expand to nothing. Similarly, an operation named \assign would read a register name and a value from the input, do the assignment and expand to nothing. This can be also extended to \let , \advance etc. Thus the above examples would now behave differently: in the first \edef , \def would read in \a{x} , define \a and expand to empty text. After this expansion the token list would contain \a , which would then expand to x . In the second example (let it be \edef\test{\assign\count1} now) \assign would set \count to 1 , and expand to nothing. In the result \test would be defined to be empty, but the value of \count would have been altered. This new system would allow to achieve some things in a more straightward manner. For example, the problem of defining a macro expanding to n asterisks could now be solved with \newcount\c \def\asterisks#1{% \assign\c0 \loop\ifnum\c<#1 *% \advance\c by 1 \repeat} , because (see the definitions of \loop and \iterate ) \def , \let and assignments are now expandable. Another substantial consequence would be that many more things could be done in macros whose result is passed as an argument to another macro. Observe how e-TeX's \numexpr and friends are already a considerable step in this direction. The question is: Why doesn't TeX implement such an approach, leaving instead some important operations non-expandable? What are the shortcomings of this approach and the advantages of TeX's implementation? One possible reason might be that Knuth wanted macros to act as has_links , incapable of changing the context they are being expanded in. A similar hint can be found in the TeXbook on the matter: The expansion of expandable tokens takes place in TeX's ""mouth,"" but primitive commands (including assignments) are done in TeX's ""stomach."" One important consequence of this structure is that it is impossible to redefine a control sequence or to advance a register while TeX is expanding the token list of, say, a \message or \write command; assignment operations are done only when TeX is building a vertical or horizontal or math list. Another reason might be that nested and/or recursive macro calls could interfere with each other if they had write access to ""external"" data available to them. Note: the question is not about what is permitted and what is not by the architecture of TeX, but about why such architecture was designed in the first place.",Why isn't everything expandable?,3,3,35188.0,3104.0,2011-11-16 11:17:56,<macros><tex-core><expansion>,,1,4904

I've been reading about different options. Some references: has_links has_links has_links These questions and answers are very helpful, but I'd like to check to see if my findings are correct. I get the feeling that XeLaTeX is more of the 'improved' version that provides easier/more font options and makes it easier when using weird characters. Most people talk about 'converting' from one TeX to another, but given the fact that I am a beginner I am looking for the proper TeX flavor right now, so that I do not need to change preambles and such when I am learning about new things that are only available when using other TeX engines. Some details about my usage: I visualize using TeX mostly for business reports, memos, and investigations. I also might use it for presentations and publishing in book-format. I will not be using advanced math nor Chinese or other very non-Latin symbols. Being a beginner, I do not need to convert any old documents. I have been reading about has_links , however, and this seems like a version that will be superior to the existing TeX options. So when this becomes available, I envision switching to this. So if that is of any validity, I'd say that easy conversion to / compatibility with LaTex3 would be important. Also, I read about an issue with 'microtype' in XeTeX, but I do not really get what that is and if this would affect me. To quote from has_links related to another beginner's question: XeLaTeX would be (especially) suitable to you, for better (Unicode) multilingual support and easy font switching. And it supports more image format and PSTricks code. I feel this also applies to my situation, so I am about to use XeLaTeX instead of LaTeX, and learn using this instead.

259,45183,102,9132,"Reading this site for the last nearly two years I've learned a lot about LaTeX3 (which I had previously understood to be a defunct pipe dream) and LuaTeX (of which I was previously totally unaware). As I have has_links , TeX itself is a bad programming language, though a good typesetting engine, but even as a typesetting engine, it is has_links as a language. What I mean by both of these, in short, is that it does not provide an easy way to manipulate its own representations of data. Others have has_links , and sometimes it has_links with LuaTeX, which opens up a lot of the internals to the programming environment. Now, as I understand it, LaTeX3 also provides a lot of programming tools within TeX, with the aim of making package creation and maintenance more robust. Joseph Wright has has_links in at least one place (and therefore probably many more). These are ""algorithmic"" tools, while the direction of LuaTeX development appears to be ""data structure"" tools. Of course, Lua is also a general-purpose programming language and as such provides perfectly good algorithmic tools as well. My question: Why use LaTeX3 programming over Lua, when LuaTex is available? I understand that LuaTeX is very much experimental now, but then, so is LaTeX3. I also understand that as a result, LuaTeX is not necessarily used by anyone ""ordinary"", but then, it is intended as the ultimate successor to pdfTeX, which is now the default engine in the major TeX distributions. For all the reasons that TeX is a terrible programming language, LaTeX3 will still suffer from irritating expansion issues, lack of arithmetic capabilities, poor (or at least poor man's) variables, and so on. However, Knuth himself has_links that he would have used a better language if one had been available. Now that ""we"" are inserting Lua into the TeX executable it appears that this alternative has been identified (ironically, that link is about PyTeX, based on Python). Now that \directlua is feasible, I don't see why it is not better in every way simply to make all ""function"" macros (those that do not directly store text) hook into that one primitive and then do all their programming in Lua. Loops, variables, recursion, and so on can all be done in a comprehensible way. A lot of effort in the development of LaTeX3 appears to be in managing the programming language and its use. So, I ask again: Why use LaTeX3 to program at all? Why not turn its development into the development of a LaTeX-style document design library for LuaTeX, written in Lua? This suggests a related question to me: Is the separation of LuaTeX and LaTeX3 a result (or at least an artifact) of the non-communication among developers that Ahmed Musa described in his comment to has_links ? What kind of cooperation is there between these two projects to reduce duplication of effort? (An even more fantastical notion is to implement every primitive, except \directlua itself, in terms of Lua and various internal typesetting parameters, thus completely divorcing the programming side of TeX from the typesetting side. Then TeX itself would be a ""macro package"" on top of LuaTeX and one would not be bound to its strange design choices. An answer to why that should or should not be done might be too long for me to request, however.) I don't personally think that this is too bloggy for this site, and I hope others agree. At least, given the confluence of expertise here, it seems to be the best place to ask the question. I have accepted Frank Mittelbach's answer, though all the answers are extremely informative, because I think it hits all the main points most directly. One thing that neither it nor Joseph Wright's answer quite manages to come out and say directly is that ConTeXt does do the Lua-programming thing at least to some extent, and it does not solve all algorithmic problems because LuaTeX does not actually rewrite the underpinnings of TeX so much as stitch in a Lua layer that can interact with them. I guess the one-line answer to my question is that my expectations of LuaTeX are much more grand than its reality, much like my ""fantastical"" idea.",LaTeX3 versus pure Lua,5,8,45226.0,575.0,2012-02-20 19:18:48,<luatex><programming><latex3><expl3>,,1,5008

So: Is there a way to make XeTeX emulate the way LuaTeX makes CMap entries? If not, is there a way to edit the font to remove any references to the Private Use Area which may ""tempt"" XeTeX to make these incorrect CMap entries? If none of that is possible, is there a way to edit the CMap entries in PDFs made by XeTeX, automatically and without needing a LuaTeX run? EDIT: Since Jörg asked, here's how I did the ""CMap transplant"": Make a file test.tex with the following contents: \documentclass{article} \usepackage{fontspec} \setmainfont[Ligatures=TeX,Numbers={OldStyle,Proportional}]{Minion Pro} \begin{document} The \mbox{\addfontfeatures{Letters=UppercaseSmallCaps}NATO} office 1234 \end{document} Compile it with xelatex and lualatex and uncompress each PDF with pdftk : xelatex test mv test.pdf test_x.pdf lualatex test mv test.pdf test_l.pdf pdftk test_x.pdf output test_xu.pdf uncompress pdftk test_l.pdf output test_lu.pdf uncompress Open each uncompressed PDF file in a text editor and look for the sections above. Delete the section from XeTeX's PDF and replace it with the equivalent section from LuaTeX's PDF (from begincodespacerange to endcmap ). The PDF is corrupted now, but pdftk will fix it: pdftk test_xu.pdf output test_xf.pdf Now test_xf.pdf will have the correct copy text. This is a neat proof-of-concept but it's useless for several reasons: You have to compile in XeTeX and LuaTeX. If my files all compiled in LuaTeX then I'd just use LuaTeX and be done with it. That's the ideal solution here anyways. You can't make a ""key file"" that compiles in LuaTeX and then just put its CMap into every PDF you make using XeTeX, since XeTeX appears to assign random input codes (e.g., <0044> , <0046> , <05C9> ) every time the file is changed. Transplanting a CMap which uses a different set of input codes results in no characters being selectable. If you use more than one font, you need to fix the CMap for each one. This applies even to the same typeface in two different optical sizes. So the only way I can see this work is if someone made a program which had a built-in list of fonts and their problematic PUA references, which would go through every CMap section in a PDF line-by-line, identify the PUA references by their targets, and then change the targets according to the list. But that seems far too much work and at a certain point you just have to migrate to LuaTeX .","Small-caps, old-style numbers, and some ligatures produce odd symbols in PDF copy text?",1,17,,9092.0,2012-03-26 12:25:05,<xetex><small-caps><ligatures><oldstylenums><copy-paste>,,1,7133

They produced diagrams such as the one shown below: Trusted and respected class authors such as Peter Wilson (memoir) and Markus Kohm ( has_links ) exhorted authors to follow these rules, sometimes very strongly, in a language reminiscent of construction specifications. Markus Kohm writes, In a double-sided document (e. g. a book) however, the complete inner margin (the margin at the spine) should be the same as each of the two outer margins; in other words, a single page contributes only half of the inner margin... Some classes such as the has_links are dedicated to achieving the classical page ratios. Having looked at over 100 books as part of some development work I am trying to complete, the most immediate and apparent observation is that most Publishers and obviously their book designers currently disregard such rules. My own feeling is that this is mostly done for monetary reasons. The books in my opinion still look very good and maybe is time to let medieval rules fall away.

Also, I would like something with an increased readability (relative to the default setting, i.e. Computer Modern ) both for on paper reading and for on screen reading, and something that is at least as good with math typing and printing. Finally, I would like a solution that I could easily use on other computers or give/suggest to a friend (i.e. it should ideally come with most standard LaTeX distributions at the present time (June 2012)). These are my motivations or goals. Initially, I used pslatex which uses Times, Helvetica, and Courier (or slightly modified versions of them). But then I discovered that pslatex is outdated, and that I should use either (just) txfonts or (the three) mathptmx , helvet ([scaled=.90]), and courier . Then I read that tgtermes is better (or at least prefered by some people). Even later (June 2012), I then heard that newtx is even better ( \usepackage[varg, cmintegrals, cmbraces, ]{newtxtext,newtxmath} ). But in the newtx / newtxtext / newtxmath documentation (and the internet follow-up searches), I got very confused about using lmodern , textcomp , bm , amsmath , amsfonts , amssymb , libertine , libertineotf , libertine-legacy (edit: initial post had a mistake ('libertine-heritage')), etc... Now I am completely lost! Considering my motivations, what would you answer me if I asked you: which ones could I use ('alone'), which ones could I use together, which ones ""should"" I use ('alone'), and which ones ""should"" I use together? Added ""bonus"" problem: I would like to keep the characters per line ratio to a nice, comfortable level (i.e. between 60 and 75), and, ideally, to be able to set it.

Is it only the compilation engine that can interpret them? Is there any hope to get a natural hook to PS (MetaPost too for that matter)? For example, in TikZ there is a command \pgfdeclarefunctionalshading which evaluates a limited collection of PS commands. (An example : has_links ) Why not more? If .pdf <=> .ps file conversion is possible, why can't it be done at the renderer level? Why can't PSTricks simply work with the pdflatex engine but rendering much of the goodies such as 3D capabilities etc. obsolete for the standard user via requiring an externalization? See also has_links Are there any .pdf and .ps file format standards conflicts both protocol- and copyright-wise, that is beyond compatibility again at the renderer level? This question was briefly mentioned in has_links and Ryan Reich implicitly proposed a soft question to be asked.

It would be great if Herbert, cjorssen (as directly taking part in the development of these tools) and other experts can shed some light. Depending on the users' opinions, I can remove this question which might be too subjective. There were even more questions but removed later (see the edits). Mandatory Disclaimer I use TikZ a lot.

So I was thinking - it shouldn't be too extremely difficult to build an application, which would basically read the logfile line by line, and allow for ""stepping"" through the logfile; I'd imagine rightarrow keyboard key -> would step you forward through the log, and leftarrow key <- would step backwards; possibly, one could specify line number of the logfile as a starting point as well. Then, the application would simply react on ' ^{changing ', ' ^{into ', and possibly ' ^\\(.*)->(.*) '; and would display the line, as well as the ""current"" token elsewhere on screen; so at the ""changing"" line, the extra portion of the screen would say \aaa=undefined ; and upon ""into"" line, the snippet would change to \aaa=macro:->something . I think just this facility would make visualizing and understanding the (La)Tex expansion process much more easy (especially in ""real"" documents). And in fact, such an application doesn't even need a full-blown GUI - I'd imagine a ncurses terminal application would do just as well (problems with display of long strings in limited width terminal notwithstanding).

This is essentially an issue of having the right output encoding. There are at least two important aspects to this: In the ideal case, Unicode would be the output encoding. Ligature glyphs (such as ﬁ) are ideally de-ligated in the output (here: ""fi""). It seems that output encodings are specified through the fontenc package. What is the range of possible output encodings, and most importantly: Is there a way to specify a Unicode output encoding and one that deals with ligatures in the intended way?

324,94523,82,7454,"I'm try to move my current paperwork routine towards a paperless workflow (for the “administrative” type of papers, of course… not for serious reading tasks). There is one major annoyance thwarting me: people sometimes require me to print, sign and scan documents. They will not allow me to insert my scanned signature in an electronic file (even converted to PDF). It's for unimportant papers (e.g., not for contracts!), it's a waste of time, but I cannot make them budge. Thus, I want to design a filter that takes PDF files as input, and gives them a “scanned document” look . What I have thought of so far: Rasterization at not-so-great resolution. I have a ghostscript-based filter that does it, and I've used it a few times already.

341,123174,60,758,"This question led to a new package: pkgloader ( has_links , has_links ) LaTeX package conflicts are a common source of frustration: has_links has_links has_links has_links has_links has_links . To quote has_links : Package conflicts in LaTeX are a hell. I've been looking around, but I don't think anyone has worked on what would seem, to me, the obvious solution: a package which automates conflict resolution for LateX packages. As it happens, my PhD research ( has_links ) matches this problem closely, so I've made a quick start on that package and I would like some feedback on the idea. The current version is temporarily stored in has_links . It depends on the l3graph package I'm working on, which is not ready for CTAN yet. The l3graph package offers a graph datastructure for expl3 with facilities for detecting cycles and working with the has_links / has_links and has_links of graphs. Package Description The pkgloader package offers tools for resolving conflicts, and is backed by a database of known resolutions. For the average user, everything would just work . The user interface looks like this: \documentclass{article} \usepackage{pkgloader} % List packages in any order you please \usepackage{xltxtra} \usepackage[xetex]{graphicx} \LoadPackagesNow \begin{document} \end{document} By redefining \usepackage (and friends), pkgloader gathers the list of packages (with options) that the user wants to load, then loads them in the right order at the \LoadPackagesNow command. The package order above (needs XeTeX) would immediately cause an error if not for pkgloader . It is able to prevent the problem because I've already included a modest list of package-ordering rules: \Load {fancyhdr} before {hyperref} \Load {fncychap} before {hyperref} \Load {float} before {hyperref} \Load {hyperref} before {algorithm} \Load {amssymb} before {xunicode} \Load {amssymb} before {xltxtra} \Load {graphicx} before {xltxtra} \Load {graphicx} before {fontspec} \Load {caption} before {subfig} These can also be added manually. Potential Features Fixing the package loading order is only the first (and simplest) step. With a bit of extra work we could add features like the following: A package ordering rule like: \Load {cleveref} late (or early ) Facilities for package authors to include their own resolutions in a uniform way Automatic detection of cycles within the rules Accumulating and combining package options, with specific rules per package Adding extra 'glue code' to make two other packages behave (if they're both being loaded) Automatically resolving pretty much every conflict listed on has_links . For conflicts that cannot (yet) be resolved, at least show an error message rather than let things go wrong at a later stage. Question: What prior work is there? Specifically: Is there already another package that does (something like) this? Are there any specific pitfalls I should be aware of? Other than has_links , is there any kind of comprehensive list of known conflicts and resolutions? I think a package like this has the potential to be very useful to a lot of people, if I do this right. A package like this will have a very wide scope.

Additionally, the function should be usable within a PSTricks plot. E.g. \psplot[ algebraic, linecolor = red, linewidth = 1pt ]{0}{TwoPi} {\myMathFunction{x}}",How can I define a mathematical function as a LaTeX macro?,11,3,147984.0,10194.0,2013-12-01 18:08:49,<pstricks><calculations><pst-plot>,,1,934

352,154096,61,2069,"Yes or no questions are pretty rare here now that I think of it. My question is simply this: When producing a PDF file with pdflatex or lualatex , is the original filename of an \includegraphics preserved in any way, shape or form in the final PDF? The reason I'm asking is that I'm using some less-than-serious filenames but if the original authors of the works I'm referencing in these images saw the names, I would have to rely a bit too much on the ability of someone I don't know to take a joke. The filename does not show up in plain text in the PDF file but neither does any of the text itself so that doesn't seem to be a reliable test. There is no tooltip or anything with any of the PDF readers I tried but again, that doesn't prove anything. Once this document is released, it would be too late to learn something about PDF files that I didn't know before. PS: If you elaborated on your ""yes"" or ""no"", that would be very much appreciated ;) Edit I think it is worth mentioning that this question might be relevant even to people who don't share my questionable sense of humor. Similar to undo information left in a Word file, seeing the original filename might reveal something about the author that they do not wish to reveal and are hardly aware of. Filenames like failed_attempt-6.png , study_plot_retouched.pdf or stand-in031.jpg are just some examples of filenames that might cast you in a strange light if uncovered by a faithful observer of your document ;)",Is the filename of an image preserved in the final PDF?,3,6,154107.0,13450.0,2014-01-14 20:18:23,<graphics><pdf>,,1,1674

I have two questions: Is this in fact true (both parts)? Given that I am required to conform to a specific format and there is a lot of repetition (for example, I often have to use \qquad\textnormal ) is there a way to define a command, and then when I run it produce a file that expands all of those macros?
