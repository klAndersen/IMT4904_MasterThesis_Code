# IMT4904 MasterThesis Source code: Feature detectors

To be able to test each feature detector systematically, this folder 
was created to keep each file. 

Filename explanation:
- numeric_value: Amount of rows retrieved from database * 2 (good and bad)
- _type: Type indicates the type of feature that was used to create this file

E.g. "feature_detector_10000_homework.csv" indicates that this file 
contains 20.000 rows (10.000 good and bad questions), and that it 
 contains the phrases 'has_homework' and 'has_assignment'.
