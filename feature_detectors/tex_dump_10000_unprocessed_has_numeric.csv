0,48295,-14,1096,"first, what is the proper terminology for a ""string"" in tex/latex that is an argument for a macro? e.g., \macro{somestring} obviously somestring is a token, set of tokens, string, argument, etc. i will call it a string since i do not know what else to call it. i'm not thinking it is another macro but sort of ""inert"" text. what i want to be able to do is parse a string that represents macros in latex but codified in a very simple way: the best way to describe it is to give an example the follow string x4y3[cgreen, t4[ has_numeric , has_numeric ,a90]] represents setting properties x-position =  has_numeric  y-position =  has_numeric  color = green test =  has_numeric  with x offset  has_numeric , y offset  has_numeric  and angle  has_numeric  [ ] = optional (optional list of optional specifiers in no particular order) it should be very self explanatory how i went from the condensed string to the properties it represents. if not stare at the string for a few hours. you should be able to read the string and tell exactly what it means after knowing what the indicator symbols are. (this is no different than what xparse does with it's specification string except mine is a little more complex) now the hard part, i want to be able to parse that string into a series of macros that set data. as you can probably guess it, the string represents something to do with placing a graphic at a location. if you want to have some interpretation for x4y3[cgreen, t4[ has_numeric , has_numeric ,a90]] to make you feel better: place a green circle at coordinates( has_numeric , has_numeric ) with a piece of text "" has_numeric "" offset ( has_numeric , has_numeric ) from it and rotated  has_numeric  degrees. to do this cleanly and efficiently i would like to create macros that are called for each corresponding macro in the string \def\x# has_numeric {} \def\y# has_numeric {} \def\c# has_numeric {} \def\t# has_numeric # has_numeric {} so we could see the string as simply calling \x{ has_numeric }\y{ has_numeric }\c{green}\t{ has_numeric }{ has_numeric , has_numeric ,a90} so as you can see the string is just a ""condensed"" version of a macro. the string simply is a command value pair with possible optional arguments. one could almost simply go in and add \'s and brackets to get the command. for example, pseudo-code: parse_string{ foreach token in command-list write '\'token'{'next_token'}' } but i would like to add commands/macros that have more than one character (the smallest token size would take precedence) and do other things like default values. anyways, as usual this is relatively straightforward in most procedural programming languages but i'm sure i'll spend the next few weeks trying to figure out how to do it in tex/latex and then 10k lines of code later i'll probably end up with a buggy as hell version.",Stringified commands to macros sequence,2,12,48320.0,11637.0,2012-03-16 20:29:53,<macros><parsing><xparse>,2014-06-21 23:52:42,-1,3203

36,451,95,16576,"i'm quite happy hacking tex macros and cobbling together bits and pieces from different style files to suit my own ends, but i have a suspicion that my resulting hacks are not quite as elegant as they could be. in particular, with regard to when to expand and when not to expand macros. a common occurrence for me is defining a meta-command that defines a whole slew of sub-commands. so the names of the sub-commands will contain parameters depending on the parameter passed to the meta-command, and the contents of the sub-commands will also vary a little depending on what the meta-command got. often it won't be a direct substitution but rather a ""if # has_numeric  is 'a' do \this else do \that"", but \this and \that need expansion at define time, not call time. here's a very simple example just involving direct substitution: \def\cohtheory# has_numeric { \expandafter\newcommand\expandafter{\csname #1func\endcsname}[ has_numeric ][*]{% \makeuppercase{# has_numeric }^{## has_numeric }} } sometimes i worry that my commands are more complicated than they need be. for example, if i want to call a command with two arguments and the arguments expand before the command, here's how i've coded it: \expandafter \expandafter \expandafter \command\expandafter \expandafter \expandafter {\expandafter \argone \expandafter }\expandafter {\argtwo} so i'm looking for guidance on when and how to control expansion in defining macros. i strongly suspect that such cannot be given in a simple answer, so to make this a focussed question, let me phrase it thus: where's a good reference for writing tex macros that includes advice on how to best deal with how to handle expansions? of course, if anyone can formulate some advice in short answer, i'd be only to happy to read it.

228,35039,57,1284,"tex's macro processor does its work in a process called expansion. for an input stream of tokens, the macro processor repeatedly expands them until non-expandable tokens remain. the resulting stream of non-expandable tokens is passed to the tex's execution processor. the process of expansion can be viewed as calling a function that expands to its result. macros absorb their arguments from the input stream and expand to their replacement text, with arguments in-place. other types of tokens can be expanded differently: for example, conditionals test their arguments (possibly expanding them, too) and skip the branch for which the condition is false. but there are also non-trivial tokens that are not expandable: most notably, \def and (not actually a token, but see below) register assignments. this means that they can't be used in a macro to obtain a result through expansion: they will be just passed through untouched. for example, \edef\test{\def\a{x}\a} will fail with ! undefined control sequence., because \def was not expanded and then \a was examined, which proved to be undefined. likewise, \newcount\count \edef\test{\count= has_numeric } \showthe\count will show  has_numeric , not  has_numeric , because, again, none of \count= has_numeric  were expandable. one can imagine a system where such operations are expandable. more precisely, expanding \def would absorb a control sequence name, parameter text and replacement text from the input stream, define the new macro and expand to nothing. similarly, an operation named \assign would read a register name and a value from the input, do the assignment and expand to nothing. this can be also extended to \let, \advance etc. thus the above examples would now behave differently: in the first \edef, \def would read in \a{x}, define \a and expand to empty text. after this expansion the token list would contain \a, which would then expand to x. in the second example (let it be \edef\test{\assign\count1} now) \assign would set \count to  has_numeric , and expand to nothing. in the result \test would be defined to be empty, but the value of \count would have been altered. this new system would allow to achieve some things in a more straightward manner. for example, the problem of defining a macro expanding to n asterisks could now be solved with \newcount\c \def\asterisks# has_numeric {% \assign\c0 \loop\ifnum\c<# has_numeric  *% \advance\c by  has_numeric  \repeat} , because (see the definitions of \loop and \iterate) \def, \let and assignments are now expandable. another substantial consequence would be that many more things could be done in macros whose result is passed as an argument to another macro. observe how e-tex's \numexpr and friends are already a considerable step in this direction. the question is: why doesn't tex implement such an approach, leaving instead some important operations non-expandable? what are the shortcomings of this approach and the advantages of tex's implementation? one possible reason might be that knuth wanted macros to act as pure functions, incapable of changing the context they are being expanded in. a similar hint can be found in the texbook on the matter: the expansion of expandable tokens takes place in tex's ""mouth,"" but primitive commands (including assignments) are done in tex's ""stomach."" one important consequence of this structure is that it is impossible to redefine a control sequence or to advance a register while tex is expanding the token list of, say, a \message or \write command; assignment operations are done only when tex is building a vertical or horizontal or math list. another reason might be that nested and/or recursive macro calls could interfere with each other if they had write access to ""external"" data available to them. note: the question is not about what is permitted and what is not by the architecture of tex, but about why such architecture was designed in the first place.",Why isn't everything expandable?,3,3,35188.0,3104.0,2011-11-16 11:17:56,<macros><tex-core><expansion>,,1,4904

259,45183,102,9132,"reading this site for the last nearly two years i've learned a lot about latex3 (which i had previously understood to be a defunct pipe dream) and luatex (of which i was previously totally unaware). as i have said before, tex itself is a bad programming language, though a good typesetting engine, but even as a typesetting engine, it is hobbled by its limitations as a language. what i mean by both of these, in short, is that it does not provide an easy way to manipulate its own representations of data. others have also had this problem, and sometimes it can be solved with luatex, which opens up a lot of the internals to the programming environment. now, as i understand it, latex3 also provides a lot of programming tools within tex, with the aim of making package creation and maintenance more robust. joseph wright has explained this in at least one place (and therefore probably many more). these are ""algorithmic"" tools, while the direction of luatex development appears to be ""data structure"" tools. of course, lua is also a general-purpose programming language and as such provides perfectly good algorithmic tools as well. my question: why use latex3 programming over lua, when luatex is available? i understand that luatex is very much experimental now, but then, so is latex3. i also understand that as a result, luatex is not necessarily used by anyone ""ordinary"", but then, it is intended as the ultimate successor to pdftex, which is now the default engine in the major tex distributions. for all the reasons that tex is a terrible programming language, latex3 will still suffer from irritating expansion issues, lack of arithmetic capabilities, poor (or at least poor man's) variables, and so on. however, knuth himself has written that he would have used a better language if one had been available. now that ""we"" are inserting lua into the tex executable it appears that this alternative has been identified (ironically, that link is about pytex, based on python). now that \directlua is feasible, i don't see why it is not better in every way simply to make all ""function"" macros (those that do not directly store text) hook into that one primitive and then do all their programming in lua. loops, variables, recursion, and so on can all be done in a comprehensible way. a lot of effort in the development of latex3 appears to be in managing the programming language and its use. so, i ask again: why use latex3 to program at all? why not turn its development into the development of a latex-style document design library for luatex, written in lua? this suggests a related question to me: is the separation of luatex and latex3 a result (or at least an artifact) of the non-communication among developers that ahmed musa described in his comment to this answer? what kind of cooperation is there between these two projects to reduce duplication of effort? (an even more fantastical notion is to implement every primitive, except \directlua itself, in terms of lua and various internal typesetting parameters, thus completely divorcing the programming side of tex from the typesetting side. then tex itself would be a ""macro package"" on top of luatex and one would not be bound to its strange design choices. an answer to why that should or should not be done might be too long for me to request, however.) i don't personally think that this is too bloggy for this site, and i hope others agree. at least, given the confluence of expertise here, it seems to be the best place to ask the question. i have accepted frank mittelbach's answer, though all the answers are extremely informative, because i think it hits all the main points most directly. one thing that neither it nor joseph wright's answer quite manages to come out and say directly is that context does do the lua-programming thing at least to some extent, and it does not solve all algorithmic problems because luatex does not actually rewrite the underpinnings of tex so much as stitch in a lua layer that can interact with them. i guess the one-line answer to my question is that my expectations of luatex are much more grand than its reality, much like my ""fantastical"" idea.",LaTeX3 versus pure Lua,5,8,45226.0,575.0,2012-02-20 19:18:48,<luatex><programming><latex3><expl3>,,1,5008

edit: since jörg asked, here's how i did the ""cmap transplant"": make a file test.tex with the following contents: \documentclass{article} \usepackage{fontspec} \setmainfont[ligatures=tex,numbers={oldstyle,proportional}]{minion pro} \begin{document} the \mbox{\addfontfeatures{letters=uppercasesmallcaps}nato} office  has_numeric  \end{document} compile it with xelatex and lualatex and uncompress each pdf with pdftk: xelatex test mv test.pdf test_x.pdf lualatex test mv test.pdf test_l.pdf pdftk test_x.pdf output test_xu.pdf uncompress pdftk test_l.pdf output test_lu.pdf uncompress open each uncompressed pdf file in a text editor and look for the sections above. delete the section from xetex's pdf and replace it with the equivalent section from luatex's pdf (from begincodespacerange to endcmap). the pdf is corrupted now, but pdftk will fix it: pdftk test_xu.pdf output test_xf.pdf now test_xf.pdf will have the correct copy text. this is a neat proof-of-concept but it's useless for several reasons: you have to compile in xetex and luatex. if my files all compiled in luatex then i'd just use luatex and be done with it. that's the ideal solution here anyways. you can't make a ""key file"" that compiles in luatex and then just put its cmap into every pdf you make using xetex, since xetex appears to assign random input codes (e.g., < has_numeric >, < has_numeric >, <05c9>) every time the file is changed. transplanting a cmap which uses a different set of input codes results in no characters being selectable. if you use more than one font, you need to fix the cmap for each one. this applies even to the same typeface in two different optical sizes. so the only way i can see this work is if someone made a program which had a built-in list of fonts and their problematic pua references, which would go through every cmap section in a pdf line-by-line, identify the pua references by their targets, and then change the targets according to the list. but that seems far too much work and at a certain point you just have to migrate to luatex.","Small-caps, old-style numbers, and some ligatures produce odd symbols in PDF copy text?",1,17,,9092.0,2012-03-26 12:25:05,<xetex><small-caps><ligatures><oldstylenums><copy-paste>,,1,7133

(an example : how to draw a shaded sphere? ) why not more? if .pdf <=> .ps file conversion is possible, why can't it be done at the renderer level? why can't pstricks simply work with the pdflatex engine but rendering much of the goodies such as 3d capabilities etc. obsolete for the standard user via requiring an externalization? see also how to use pstricks in pdflatex? are there any .pdf and .ps file format standards conflicts both protocol- and copyright-wise, that is beyond compatibility again at the renderer level? this question was briefly mentioned in the interview with andrew stacey and ryan reich implicitly proposed a soft question to be asked. after wondering a bit, i found out that i have some big potholes in the story, though i vaguely know some of the answers to the questions above. it would be great if herbert, cjorssen (as directly taking part in the development of these tools) and other experts can shed some light. depending on the users' opinions, i can remove this question which might be too subjective. there were even more questions but removed later (see the edits). mandatory disclaimer i use tikz a lot. also i sometimes include pictures created with pstricks (as long as i understand how to use the klingon syntax). i really enjoy the convenience of these tools and don't want to choose one for the other. why can't we just talk ? an insider story complements the answers below towards the end on this video; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rcnnmzrfuq&t=9m52s","Fundamental differences : PSTricks, TikZ/PGF and others",3,3,60792.0,3235.0,2012-06-22 03:36:27,<tikz-pgf><graphics><pstricks><metapost>,,1,3101

310,78193,71,1407,"i am trying to emulate margin notes as they are in my (favourite) macroeconomics textbook. the crucial thing here is that the little arrow points to the line where the margin note is set. i have come up with the following dirty code. edit: i have updated the code below to provide some commands that either centre the note, push it upwards or allow manual adjustment (thanks to egreg, andrew swann and martin scharrer who helped me with problems related to this). the normal \marginpar command is used to set the note and \marginnote is used to set the text. marginfix takes good care of notes at the bottom of page (see the last note in the picture). however, i would like to create some automatic process that moves the note: if the note is at the end of a paragraph/section/chapter move it up (see second note). find an equivalent to marginfix that moves the note to the top margin of the page if there is enough space. this does not cover all usecases, so what is needed is some clever automatic mechanism that adjusts the position of the notes but keeps the arrow fixed. can something like that be done? are there any ""ifatendparagraph"" or

341,123174,60,758,"this question led to a new package: pkgloader(ctan, github) latex package conflicts are a common source of frustration: ( has_numeric ) ( has_numeric ) ( has_numeric ) ( has_numeric ) ( has_numeric ) ( has_numeric ). to quote freek dijkstra: package conflicts in latex are a hell. i've been looking around, but i don't think anyone has worked on what would seem, to me, the obvious solution: a package which automates conflict resolution for latex packages. as it happens, my phd research (delta modeling) matches this problem closely, so i've made a quick start on that package and i would like some feedback on the idea. the current version is temporarily stored in an svn branch for another package. it depends on the l3graph package i'm working on, which is not ready for ctan yet. the l3graph package offers a graph datastructure for expl3 with facilities for detecting cycles and working with the transitive closure/reduction and topological order of graphs. package description the pkgloader package offers tools for resolving conflicts, and is backed by a database of known resolutions. for the average user, everything would just work. the user interface looks like this: \documentclass{article} \usepackage{pkgloader} % list packages in any order you please \usepackage{xltxtra} \usepackage[xetex]{graphicx} \loadpackagesnow \begin{document} \end{document} by redefining \usepackage (and friends), pkgloader gathers the list of packages (with options) that the user wants to load, then loads them in the right order at the \loadpackagesnow command. the package order above (needs xetex) would immediately cause an error if not for pkgloader. it is able to prevent the problem because i've already included a modest list of package-ordering rules: \load {fancyhdr} before {hyperref} \load {fncychap} before {hyperref} \load {float} before {hyperref} \load {hyperref} before {algorithm} \load {amssymb} before {xunicode} \load {amssymb} before {xltxtra} \load {graphicx} before {xltxtra} \load {graphicx} before {fontspec} \load {caption} before {subfig} these can also be added manually. potential features fixing the package loading order is only the first (and simplest) step. with a bit of extra work we could add features like the following: a package ordering rule like: \load {cleveref} late (or early) facilities for package authors to include their own resolutions in a uniform way automatic detection of cycles within the rules accumulating and combining package options, with specific rules per package adding extra 'glue code' to make two other packages behave (if they're both being loaded) automatically resolving pretty much every conflict listed on freek's page. for conflicts that cannot (yet) be resolved, at least show an error message rather than let things go wrong at a later stage. question: what prior work is there? specifically: is there already another package that does (something like) this? are there any specific pitfalls i should be aware of? other than freek's page, is there any kind of comprehensive list of known conflicts and resolutions? i think a package like this has the potential to be very useful to a lot of people, if i do this right. a package like this will have a very wide scope. i don't want to step on anyone's toes, so please help me do this right. i'd be happy to collaborate with the community on this - any feedback is welcome, so contact me if you're interested.",Automated management of package options and loading order,1,31,158605.0,14886.0,2013-07-08 21:31:06,<incompatibility><package-options>,,1,5700
