0,48295,-14,1096,"first, what is the proper terminology for a ""string"" in tex/latex that is an argument for a macro? e.g., \macro{somestring} obviously somestring is a token, set of tokens, string, argument, etc. i will call it a string since i do not know what else to call it. i'm not thinking it is another macro but sort of ""inert"" text. what i want to be able to do is parse a string that represents  has_external_tag  in latex but cod has_external_tag ied in a very simple way: the best way to describe it is to give an example the follow string x4y3[cgreen, t4[-3,4,a90]] represents setting properties x-position = 4 y-position = 3  has_external_tag  = green test = 4 with x offset -3, y offset 4 and  has_external_tag  90 [ ] = optional (optional list of optional spec has_external_tag iers in no particular order) it should be very self explanatory how i went from the condensed string to the properties it represents.  has_external_tag  not stare at the string for a few hours. you should be able to read the string and tell exactly what it means after knowing what the indicator  has_external_tag  are. (this is no d has_external_tag ferent than what  has_external_tag  does with it's spec has_external_tag ication string except mine is a little more complex) now the hard part, i want to be able to parse that string into a series of  has_external_tag  that set data. as you can probably guess it, the string represents something to do with placing a graphic at a location.  has_external_tag  you want to have some interpretation for x4y3[cgreen, t4[-3,4,a90]] to make you feel better: place a green circle at  has_external_tag (4,3) with a piece of text ""4"" offset (-3,4) from it and rotated 90  has_external_tag . to do this cleanly and efficiently i would like to create  has_external_tag  that are called for each corresponding macro in the string \def\x#1{} \def\y#1{} \def\c#1{} \def\t#1#2{} so we could see the string as simply calling \x{-3}\y{4}\c{green}\t{4}{-3,4,a90} so as you can see the string is just a ""condensed"" version of a macro. the string simply is a command value pair with possible optional arguments. one could almost simply go in and add \'s and  has_external_tag  to get the command. for example, pseudo- has_external_tag : parse_string{  has_external_tag  token in command-list  has_external_tag  '\'token'{'next_token'}' } but i would like to add commands/ has_external_tag  that have more than one character (the smallest token  has_external_tag  would take precedence) and do other things like default values. anyways, as usual this is relatively straightforward in most procedural  has_attached_tag   has_external_tag  but i'm sure i'll spend the next few weeks trying to figure out how to do it in tex/latex and then 10k lines of  has_external_tag  later i'll probably end up with a buggy as hell version.",Stringified commands to macros sequence,2,12,48320.0,11637.0,2012-03-16 20:29:53,<macros><parsing><xparse>,2014-06-21 23:52:42,-1,3203

(incidentally, when i try to enter the “correct” cmyk value in  has_external_tag , it “auto-corrects” my value to some other value. wut?) now, this mightn’t seem like a tex related question at all. but, long story short, how can i reliably reproduce colours in  has_external_tag latex/xelatex? i know that the issue is confounded by the fact that  has_external_tag  (which is the format of the above  has_external_tag shots) uses an own colour model and so the  has_external_tag  shots may look different on your pc than on mine. but since i pasted the colours into the same image, i think that the difference should be preserved.",PDF colour model and LaTeX,1,19,9973.0,42.0,2011-01-31 15:37:37,<pdf><color>,,1,2439

228,35039,57,1284,"tex's macro processor does its work in a process called  has_external_tag . for an  has_external_tag  stream of tokens, the macro processor repeatedly expands them until non-expandable tokens remain. the resulting stream of non-expandable tokens is passed to the tex's execution processor. the process of  has_external_tag  can be viewed as calling a function that expands to its result.  has_external_tag  absorb their arguments from the  has_external_tag  stream and expand to their replacement text, with arguments in-place. other types of tokens can be expanded d has_external_tag ferently: for example,  has_external_tag  test their arguments (possibly expanding them, too) and skip the branch for which the condition is false. but there are also non-trivial tokens that are not expandable: most notably, \def and (not actually a token, but see below) register assignments. this means that they can't be used in a macro to obtain a result through  has_external_tag : they will be just passed through untouched. for example, \edef\test{\def\a{x}\a} will fail with ! undefined control sequence., because \def was not expanded and then \a was examined, which proved to be undefined. likewise, \newcount\count \edef\test{\count=1} \showthe\count will show 0, not 1, because, again, none of \count=1 were expandable. one can imagine a system where such operations are expandable. more precisely, expanding \def would absorb a control sequence name, parameter text and replacement text from the  has_external_tag  stream, define the new macro and expand to nothing. similarly, an operation named \assign would read a register name and a value from the  has_external_tag , do the assignment and expand to nothing. this can be also extended to \let, \advance etc. thus the above  has_external_tag  would now behave d has_external_tag ferently: in the first \edef, \def would read in \a{x}, define \a and expand to empty text. after this  has_external_tag  the token list would contain \a, which would then expand to x. in the second example (let it be \edef\test{\assign\count1} now) \assign would set \count to 1, and expand to nothing. in the result \test would be defined to be empty, but the value of \count would have been altered. this new system would allow to achieve some things in a more straightward manner. for example, the problem of defining a macro expanding to n asterisks could now be solved with \newcount\c \def\asterisks#1{% \assign\c0 \loop\ has_external_tag num\c<#1 *% \advance\c by 1 \repeat} , because (see the definitions of \loop and \iterate) \def, \let and assignments are now expandable. another substantial consequence would be that many more things could be done in  has_external_tag  whose result is passed as an argument to another macro. observe how  has_external_tag 's \numexpr and friends are already a considerable step in this direction. the question is: why doesn't tex implement such an approach, leaving instead some important operations non-expandable? what are the shortcomings of this approach and the advantages of tex's implementation? one possible reason might be that  has_external_tag  wanted  has_external_tag  to act as pure functions, incapable of changing the  has_external_tag  they are being expanded in. a similar hint can be found in the texbook on the matter: the  has_external_tag  of expandable tokens takes place in tex's ""mouth,"" but primitive commands (including assignments) are done in tex's ""stomach."" one important consequence of this structure is that it is impossible to redefine a control sequence or to advance a register while tex is expanding the token list of, say, a \message or \ has_external_tag  command; assignment operations are done only when tex is building a vertical or horizontal or math list. another reason might be that nested and/or recursive macro calls could interfere with each other  has_external_tag  they had  has_external_tag  access to ""external"" data available to them. note: the question is not about what is permitted and what is not by the architecture of tex, but about why such architecture was designed in the first place.",Why isn't everything expandable?,3,3,35188.0,3104.0,2011-11-16 11:17:56,<macros><tex-core><expansion>,,1,4904

259,45183,102,9132,"reading this site for the last nearly two years i've learned a lot about  has_external_tag  (which i had previously understood to be a defunct pipe dream) and  has_external_tag  (of which i was previously totally unaware). as i have said before, tex itself is a bad  has_external_tag  language, though a good typesetting engine, but even as a typesetting engine, it is hobbled by its limitations as a language. what i mean by both of these, in short, is that it does not provide an easy way to manipulate its own representations of data. others have also had this problem, and sometimes it can be solved with  has_external_tag , which opens up a lot of the internals to the  has_external_tag  environment. now, as i understand it,  has_external_tag  also provides a lot of  has_external_tag   has_external_tag  within tex, with the aim of making package creation and maintenance more robust. joseph wright has explained this in at least one place (and therefore probably many more). these are "" has_external_tag ""  has_external_tag , while the direction of  has_external_tag  development appears to be ""data structure""  has_external_tag . of course,  has_external_tag  is also a general-purpose  has_external_tag  language and as such provides perfectly good  has_external_tag   has_external_tag  as well. my question: why use  has_external_tag   has_external_tag  over  has_external_tag , when  has_external_tag  is available? i understand that  has_external_tag  is very much experimental now, but then, so is  has_external_tag . i also understand that as a result,  has_external_tag  is not necessarily used by anyone ""ordinary"", but then, it is intended as the ultimate successor to  has_external_tag , which is now the default engine in the major tex  has_external_tag . for all the reasons that tex is a terrible  has_external_tag  language,  has_external_tag  will still suffer from irritating  has_external_tag  issues, lack of arithmetic capabilities, poor (or at least poor man's) variables, and so on. however,  has_external_tag  himself has written that he would have used a better language  has_external_tag  one had been available. now that ""we"" are inserting  has_external_tag  into the tex executable it appears that this alternative has been ident has_external_tag ied (ironically, that link is about pytex, based on  has_external_tag ). now that \direct has_external_tag  is feasible, i don't see why it is not better in every way simply to make all ""function""  has_attached_tag  (those that do not directly store text) hook into that one primitive and then do all their  has_external_tag  in  has_external_tag .  has_external_tag , variables,  has_external_tag , and so on can all be done in a comprehensible way. a lot of effort in the development of  has_external_tag  appears to be in managing the  has_external_tag  language and its use. so, i ask again: why use  has_external_tag  to  has_external_tag  at all? why not turn its development into the development of a latex-style document design library for  has_external_tag , written in  has_external_tag ? this suggests a related question to me: is the separation of  has_external_tag  and  has_external_tag  a result (or at least an art has_external_tag act) of the non-communication among developers that ahmed musa described in his comment to this answer? what kind of cooperation is there between these two projects to reduce duplication of effort? (an even more fantastical notion is to implement every primitive, except \direct has_external_tag  itself, in terms of  has_external_tag  and various internal typesetting  has_external_tag , thus completely divorcing the  has_external_tag  side of tex from the typesetting side. then tex itself would be a ""macro package"" on top of  has_external_tag  and one would not be bound to its strange design choices. an answer to why that should or should not be done might be too long for me to request, however.) i don't personally think that this is too bloggy for this site, and i hope others agree. at least, given the confluence of expertise here, it seems to be the best place to ask the question. i have accepted frank mittelbach's answer, though all the  has_external_tag  are extremely informative, because i think it hits all the main points most directly. one thing that neither it nor joseph wright's answer quite manages to come out and say directly is that  has_external_tag  does do the  has_external_tag - has_external_tag  thing at least to some extent, and it does not solve all  has_external_tag  problems because  has_external_tag  does not actually rewrite the underpinnings of tex so much as stitch in a  has_external_tag  layer that can interact with them. i guess the one-line answer to my question is that my expectations of  has_external_tag  are much more grand than its reality, much like my ""fantastical"" idea.",LaTeX3 versus pure Lua,5,8,45226.0,575.0,2012-02-20 19:18:48,<luatex><programming><latex3><expl3>,,1,5008

(an example : how to draw a shaded sphere? ) why not more?  has_external_tag  .pdf <=> . has_external_tag  file  has_external_tag  is possible, why can't it be done at the renderer level? why can't  has_external_tag  simply work with the pdflatex engine but  has_external_tag  much of the goodies such as  has_external_tag  capabilities etc.  has_external_tag  for the standard user via requiring an externalization? see also how to use  has_external_tag  in pdflatex? are there any .pdf and . has_external_tag  file format standards conflicts both protocol- and copyright-wise, that is beyond compatibility again at the renderer level? this question was briefly mentioned in the interview with andrew stacey and ryan reich implicitly proposed a soft question to be asked. after wondering a bit, i found out that i have some big potholes in the story, though i vaguely know some of the  has_external_tag  to the questions above. it would be great  has_external_tag  herbert, cjorssen (as directly taking part in the development of these  has_external_tag ) and other experts can shed some light. depending on the users' opinions, i can remove this question which might be too  has_external_tag . there were even more questions but removed later (see the edits). mandatory disclaimer i use tikz a lot. also i sometimes  has_external_tag  pictures created with  has_external_tag  (as long as i understand how to use the klingon  has_external_tag ). i really enjoy the convenience of these  has_external_tag  and don't want to choose one for the other. why can't we just talk ? an insider story complements the  has_external_tag  below towards the end on this video; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rcnnmzrfuq&t=9m52s","Fundamental differences : PSTricks, TikZ/PGF and others",3,3,60792.0,3235.0,2012-06-22 03:36:27,<tikz-pgf><graphics><pstricks><metapost>,,1,3101
