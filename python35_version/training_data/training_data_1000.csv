4,416914,-6,3129,"This post is not really a question, but it could be useful to share some coding tips. Here is the one I'd like to share with you. I'm going to show  has_numeric  examples that do the same thing. But only the last one will be the best. has_codeblock I'm sure you all know that has_codeblock won't work, but still, I'm pretty sure that you use double quote to display a simple information. This is bad . Well let's begin : The first one is bad (as well as the second) because using double quote forces php to scan the string to look for a substitution to be done (I mean a variable). The second one is a little better, since php has no replacement to do. The third one, is better because of simple quote, so that the language knows he can just send the text without processing, but the ""bad"" thing is the use of concatenation (dot operator, like in the second example). The last one uses simple quote, and the coma operator. Why is this solution better? Well, what happens when Using the third solution? php creates a string, containing has_codeblock , then it has to enlarge it, to put the content of foo variable (""John SMITH""), and then, enlarge it again to put has_codeblock sentence. Then, has_codeblock can use this, to ... echo it :) Whereas in the 4th one, the only thing to do for has_codeblock is to send ""Hello "", then $foo's content, then "" Welcome on my website."" to the output, and that is all! Because echo just has to send the text, without creating a string that will have to be enlarged to contain the whole text (that would have been concave, which has to be grown (because of concatenation) and then displayed. I'll try to find back some benchmarks and put them here.

JQuery functions are fired when the related elements are loaded, instead of complete pageload. This is a common practice to call a javascript function when page is loaded like has_codeblock or has_codeblock Inside of which is the code that we want to run right when the page is loaded. Problematically, however, the Javascript code isn't run until all images are finished downloading (this includes banner ads). The reason for using window.onload in the first place is due to the fact that the HTML 'document' isn't finished loading yet, when you first try to run your code.

You are going to the following algorithm based on geometric probability. Think about a quarter circle inside of a unite square (the quarter circle has area pi/ has_numeric ). You pick a random point inside the square. if it is in the quarter circle, you get a ""hit"" and if not, you get a ""miss"". The approximate area of the quarter circle will be giving by the number of hits divided by the number of points you chose.

Controls range from simple text fields to complex, composite client-side controls. It all works very well, but I've noticed something I feel is anomalous. During the course of writing code to retrieve form controls. gather their data and persist it to my database I noticed that their type reverts to the way objects get typed if you write your code in the (v. irritating) VS 'website project' mode.

This would be unreliable, and I couldn't find adequate documentation on any tools that could be used to easily patch it. I could also bypass the check altogether by just calling the later function directly if I could parse a few strings out of the assembly. This would be easier, but is the least unreliable, if anything significant was changed my code would break.

600,8201638,-6,573,"I am developing this Delhi  has_numeric  app with SQLite database version  has_numeric . has_numeric . has_numeric , accessed by the Zeos components. Started off OK - I can create a DB if none exists, create tables and insert records - the 'normal stuff'. There is a little table that contains serial params for a connection to some old equipments and the serial comms handler needs to be informed of connection parameter changes, but the Zeos components do not support events on SQLite. I looked at the SQLite API and there is a 'Data change notification callback', so I set about making this happen. The setup prototype is: has_codeblock So, in Delphi, I imported the DLL call: has_codeblock ..and declared an empty callback for testing: has_codeblock ..and called the setup: has_codeblock has_codeblock is the has_codeblock pointer for the database as retrieved from the driver after connection. has_codeblock is the DataModule instance so that, when working correctly, I can call some method from the callback, (yes, I know callback is in an unknown thread - I can deal with that OK, I'll just be signaling semaphores). Good news: when I ran the app, the has_codeblock was called, aparrently successfully, upon the first insert. Bad news: some little time later, the app blew up with 'Too many exceptions', and usually a CPU window full of '??', (the occasional alternative was system death and a reboot - Vista Ultimate  has_numeric ). Breaking in the callback, aux, has_codeblock and has_codeblock were all as expected but the debugger tooltip showed the has_codeblock / has_codeblock has_codeblock to be pointing at a string of Chinese characters.. I tried to trace where the callback is called from - the call chain passes through in the Zeos driver code, for some reason. Breaking there and stepping through, I checked the stack pointer and it's the same before and after the callback. So, I set up the 'empty' callback, the callback gets called at the expected point but with a coupe of dodgy-looking parameters, the callback returns to whence it came with the SP correct. I seem to have done everything right, but... :(( Has anyone seen this, (or fixed it even:)? Can you suggest a mechanism whereby an aparrently successful callback can pesuade an app to later generate recursive exceptions? Does anyone have any suggestions for further debugging?

Since I implemented NativeJpg  has_numeric . has_numeric  , I have been noticing that a has_codeblock uses approximately  has_numeric  times as much memory as the has_codeblock . I'm not concerned about resolving how much it reserves, but rather to make sure my threads manage the memory properly. Specifications has_codeblock is the main component for this system. Every time a picture needs to be loaded, a thread is spawned to acquire that image. When the image is available, an event is triggered providing this image in the form of a has_codeblock . Component has a queue, and a limitation of how many threads can be active at once (via has_codeblock property). Every picture requested immediately creates a thread - but the thread is not executed until necessary. has_codeblock determines how many of these threads can run at a time (otherwise, how many pictures can be loaded at a time). Problem has_codeblock always loads the pictures fine with no errors. But, using a global conditional, I enable the use of NativeJpg ( has_codeblock ) and I have memory problems. The error message is has_codeblock . This error is raised only internally (in debug), and actually does not show any error when the app is running stand-alone. It doesn't go to any breakpoint in my code, but rather in the has_codeblock unit on line  has_numeric : has_codeblock Using the standard has_codeblock , I never have problems with memory. Whether I load the picture once and then clear it from the memory, or load the picture once and save it somewhere in the memory, either way doesn't seem to make a difference.

When analyzing the memory usage, I'm seeing this... Question How do I avoid this error in any situation? This system will be used in many environments, many of which will be very sluggish computers.

1140,6371,132,15175,"I've had a hard time trying to find good examples of how to manage database schemas and data between development, test, and production servers. Here's our setup. Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN. We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build. We have a test (virtual) server that runs ""release candidates."" Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server. Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy. If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is ""base"" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables. This is the biggest barrier I see in moving toward continuous integration and one-step-builds. How do you solve it? A follow-up question: how do you track database versions so you know which scripts to run to upgrade a given database instance? Is a version table like Lance mentions below the standard procedure? Thanks for the reference to Tarantino. I'm not in a .NET environment, but I found their DataBaseChangeMangement wiki page to be very helpful. Especially this Powerpoint Presentation (.ppt) I'm going to write a Python script that checks the names of has_codeblock scripts in a given directory against a table in the database and runs the ones that aren't there in order based on a integer that forms the first part of the filename. If it is a pretty simple solution, as I suspect it will be, then I'll post it here. I've got a working script for this. It handles initializing the DB if it doesn't exist and running upgrade scripts as necessary. There are also switches for wiping an existing database and importing test data from a file.

Here's a screenshot of it currently. Any ideas? @Chris A good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize. I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it. As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space. I can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable. Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes  has_numeric  or  has_numeric  (one takes  has_numeric ) lines. Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major no-no. I guess I should be a bit more specific. I'm after vertical resizing, and the width doesn't matter as much. The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number (the large "" has_numeric "") gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small (as you can see on the screenshot). It's not about having a gimick; it's about having a text field the user can edit that won't take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it. Though if someone comes up with another way to approach the problem I'm open to that too. I've modified the code a little because it was acting a little odd.

I know that this could spill over into a debate regarding 32bit vs 64bit on servers, but let's just say that my preference is 64bit and that I have some very good reasons.

It also has a dependency on the libevent for which I can only get a Win32 compiled version. I suspect that simply loading all this up in C++ and hitting ""compile"" (for 64bit) wouldn't work, not least because of the intricate differences in  has_numeric  and 64bit architectures, but I'm wondering if anyone is workng on getting this off the ground?

Is anyone planning on porting this to 64bit? Or are you really suggesting that I use MS Velocity instead? I shudder at the thought... Update: @Lars - I do use Enyim actually - it's very good, but what you're referring to is a client, rather than the server part. @DannySmurf - I've only been able to install it as a service on a  has_numeric  bit OS.  has_numeric  bit OS rejects the installation of this Win32 service.

There's almost nothing of value there that isn't in source control (and these aren't our main dev boxes), but it would be nice to keep them anyway. there must be a better way So, my question is, how should I be doing this properly? The requirements are: needs to be an offsite backup (one of the main things I'm doing here is protecting against fire/whatever) should require as little manual intervention as possible (I'm lazy, and box-herding isn't my main job) should continue to scale with a couple more boxes, slightly more data, etc. preferably free/open source (cost isn't the issue, but especially for backups, openness seems like a good thing) an option to produce some kind of DVD/Blu-Ray/whatever backup from time to time wouldn't be bad My first thought was that this kind of incremental backup was what tar was created for - create a tar file once each month, add incrementally to it. rsync results to remote box. But others probably have better suggestions. I figured I should give it a few hours before accepting an answer, since in this case there's no right or wrong answer, just answers that seem better or worse.

So in an attempt to consolidate the knowledge I've acquired on Linq I'm posting this question with a view to maintaining and updating it with additional information as I continue to learn about LINQ. I also hope that it will prove to be a useful resource for other people wanting to learn about LINQ. What is LINQ? From MSDN : The LINQ Project is a codename for a set of extensions to the .NET Framework that encompass language-integrated query, set, and transform operations. It extends C# and Visual Basic with native language syntax for queries and provides class libraries to take advantage of these capabilities. What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax. What flavours of LINQ are there? Currently there are a few different LINQ providers provided by Microsoft: Linq to Objects which allows you to execute queries on any IEnumerable object. Linq to SQL which allows you to execute queries against a database in an object oriented manner. Linq to XML which allows you to query, load, validate, serialize and manipulate XML documents. Linq to Entities as suggested by Andrei Linq to Dataset There are quite a few others, many of which are listed here . What are the benefits? Standardized way to query multiple datasources Compile time safety of queries Optimized way to perform set based operations on in memory objects Ability to debug queries So what can I do with LINQ? Chook provides a way to output CSV files Jeff shows how to remove duplicates from an array Bob gets a distinct ordered list from a datatable Marxidad shows how to sort an array Dana gets help implementing a Quick Sort Using Linq Where to start?

(You could always write your code in notepad and compile using MSBuild) There is also a tool called LinqBridge which will allow you to run Linq like queries in C#  has_numeric . has_numeric .

1260,17732,87,22920,"There's a discussion going on over at comp.lang.c++.moderated about whether or not assertions, which in C++ only exist in debug builds by default, should be kept in production code or not. Obviously, each project is unique, so my question here is not so much whether assertions should be kept, but in which cases this is recommendable/not a good idea. By assertion, I mean: A run-time check that tests a condition which, when false, reveals a bug in the software. A mechanism by which the program is halted (maybe after really minimal clean-up work). I'm not necessarily talking about C or C++. My own opinion is that if you're the programmer, but don't own the data (which is the case with most commercial desktop applications), you should keep them on, because a failing asssertion shows a bug, and you should not go on with a bug, with the risk of corrupting the user's data. This forces you to test strongly before you ship, and makes bugs more visible, thus easier to spot and fix. What's your opinion/experience? Cheers, Carl See related question here Responses and Updates Hey Graham, An assertion is error, pure and simple and therefore should be handled like one. Since an error should be handled in release mode then you don't really need assertions. That's why I prefer the word ""bug"" when talking about assertions. It makes things much clearer. To me, the word ""error"" is too vague. A missing file is an error, not a bug, and the program should deal with it. Trying to dereference a null pointer is a bug, and the program should acknowledge that something smells like bad cheese. Hence, you should test the pointer with an assertion, but the presence of the file with normal error-handling code. Slight off-topic, but an important point in the discussion. As a heads-up, if your assertions break into the debugger when they fail, why not. But there are plenty of reasons a file could not exist that are completely outside of the control of your code: read/write rights, disk full, USB device unplugged, etc. Since you don't have control over it, I feel assertions are not the right way to deal with that. Carl Thomas, Yes, I have Code Complete, and must say I strongly disagree with that particular advice. Say your custom memory allocator screws up, and zeroes a chunk of memory that is still used by some other object. I happens to zero a pointer that this object dereferences regularly, and one of the invariants is that this pointer is never null, and you have a couple of assertions to make sure it stays that way. What do you do if the pointer suddenly is null. You just if() around it, hoping that it works? Remember, we're talking about product code here, so there's no breaking into the debugger and inspecting the local state. This is a real bug on the user's machine.

1271,18655,134,12470,"Ok, I realize I might be downvoted into oblivion for this question, especially given my stance on the matter, but I really need to see some honest, thoughtful debate on the merits of the currently accepted enterprise application design paradigm. I am not convinced that entity objects should exist. By entity objects I mean the typical things we tend to build for our applications, like ""Person"", ""Account"", ""Order"", etc. My current design philosophy is this: All database access must be accomplished via stored procedures. Whenever you need data, call a stored procedure and iterate over a SqlDataReader or the rows in a DataTable (Note: I have also built enterprise applications with Java EE, java folks please substitute the equvalent for my .NET examples) I am not anti-OO. I write lots of classes for different purposes, just not entities. I will admit that a large portion of the classes I write are static helper classes. I am not building toys. I'm talking about large, high volume transactional applications deployed across multiple machines. Web applications, windows services, web services, b2b interaction, you name it. I have used OR Mappers. I have written a few. I have used the Java EE stack, CSLA, and a few other equivalents. I have not only used them but actively developed and maintained these applications in production environments. I have come to the battle-tested conclusion that entity objects are getting in our way, and our lives would be so much easier without them. Consider this simple example: you get a support call about a certain page in your application that is not working correctly, maybe one of the fields is not being persisted like it should be. With my model, the developer assigned to find the problem opens exactly  has_numeric  files . An ASPX, an ASPX.CS and a SQL file with the stored procedure. The problem, which might be a missing parameter to the stored procedure call, takes minutes to solve. But with any entity model, you will invariably fire up the debugger, start stepping through code, and you may end up with  has_numeric  has_numeric  files open in Visual Studio. By the time you step down to the bottom of the stack, you forgot where you started. We can only keep so many things in our heads at one time. Software is incredibly complex without adding any unnecessary layers. Development complexity and troubleshooting are just one side of my gripe. Now let's talk about scalability. Do developers realize that each and every time they write or modify any code that interacts with the database, they need to do a throrough analysis of the exact impact on the database? And not just the development copy, I mean a mimic of production, so you can see that the additional column you now require for your object just invalidated the current query plan and a report that was running in  has_numeric  second will now take  has_numeric  minutes, just because you added a single column to the select list? And it turns out that the index you now require is so big that the DBA is going to have to modify the physical layout of your files? If you let people get too far away from the physical data store with an abstraction, they will create havoc with an application that needs to scale. I am not a zealot. I can be convinced if I am wrong, and maybe I am, since there is such a strong push towards Linq to Sql, ADO.NET EF, Hibernate, Java EE, etc. Please think through your responses, if I am missing something I really want to know what it is, and why I should change my thinking. [Edit] It looks like this question is suddenly active again, so now that we have the new comment feature I have commented directly on several answers. Thanks for the replies, I think this is a healthy discussion. I probably should have been more clear that I am talking about enterprise applications. I really can't comment on, say, a game that's running on someone's desktop, or a mobile app. One thing I have to put up here at the top in response to several similar answers: orthogonality and separation of concerns often get cited as reasons to go entity/ORM. Stored procedures, to me, are the best example of separation of concerns that I can think of. If you disallow all other access to the database, other than via stored procedures, you could in theory redesign your entire data model and not break any code, so long as you maintained the inputs and outputs of the stored procedures. They are a perfect example of programming by contract (just so long as you avoid ""select *"" and document the result sets). Ask someone who's been in the industry for a long time and has worked with long-lived applications: how many application and UI layers have come and gone while a database has lived on? How hard is it to tune and refactor a database when there are  has_numeric  or  has_numeric  different persistence layers generating SQL to get at the data? You can't change anything!

1282,19164,72,4710,"I am often amazed at how little some of my colleagues know or care about their craft. Something that constantly frustrates me is that people don't want to learn any more than they need to about the programming languages they use every day. Many programmers seem content to learn some pidgin sub-dialect, and stick with that. If they see a keyword or construct that they aren't familiar with, they'll complain that the code is ""tricky."" What would you think of a civil engineer who shied away from calculus because it had ""all those tricky math symbols?"" I'm not suggesting that we all need to become ""language lawyers."" But if you make your living as a programmer, and claim to be a competent user of language X, then I think at a minimum you should know the following: the keywords of the language and what they do the valid syntactic forms how memory, files, and other operating system resources are managed where the official language specification and library reference for the language is The last one is the one that really gets me. Many programmers seem to have no idea that there is a ""specification"" or ""standard"" for any particular language. I still talk to people who think that Microsoft invented C++, and that if a program doesn't compile under VC6, it's not a valid C++ program. Programmers these days have it easy when it comes to obtaining specs. Newer languages like C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. all have their documentation available for free from the vendors' web sites. Older languages and platforms often have standards controlled by standards bodies that demand payment for specs, but even that shouldn't be a deterrent: the C++ standard is available from ISO for $ has_numeric  (and why am I the only person I know who has a copy?). Programming is hard enough even when you do know the language. If you don't, I don't see how you have a chance. What do the rest of you think? Am I right, or should we all be content with the typical level of programming language expertise? Update: Several great comments here. A couple of people hit on something that I didn't think about: What really irks me is not the lack of knowledge, but the lack of curiosity and willingness to learn. It seems some people don't have any time to hone their craft, but they have plenty of time to write lots of bad code. I don't expect people to be able to recite a list of keywords or EBNF expressions, or to spend their free time browsing through specs, but I do expect that when they see some code, they should have some inkling of what it does. Few people have complete knowledge of every dark corner of their language or platform, but everyone should at least know enough that when they see something unfamiliar, they will know how to get whatever additional information they need to understand it.

1289,20047,79,25834,"We're seeing some pernicious, but rare, deadlock conditions in the Stack Overflow SQL Server  has_numeric  database. I attached the profiler, set up a trace profile using this excellent article on troubleshooting deadlocks , and captured a bunch of examples. The weird thing is that the deadlocking write is always the same : has_codeblock The other deadlocking statement varies, but it's usually some kind of trivial, simple read of the posts table. This one always gets killed in the deadlock. Here's an example has_codeblock To be perfectly clear, we are not seeing write / write deadlocks, but read / write. We have a mixture of LINQ and parameterized SQL queries at the moment. We have added has_codeblock to all the SQL queries. This may have helped some. We also had a single (very) poorly-written badge query that I fixed yesterday, which was taking upwards of  has_numeric  seconds to run every time, and was running every minute on top of that. I was hoping this was the source of some of the locking problems! Unfortunately, I got another deadlock error about  has_numeric  hours ago. Same exact symptoms, same exact culprit write. The truly strange thing is that the locking write SQL statement you see above is part of a very specific code path. It's only executed when a new answer is added to a question -- it updates the parent question with the new answer count and last date/user. This is, obviously, not that common relative to the massive number of reads we are doing! As far as I can tell, we're not doing huge numbers of writes anywhere in the app. I realize that NOLOCK is sort of a giant hammer, but most of the queries we run here don't need to be that accurate. Will you care if your user profile is a few seconds out of date? Using NOLOCK with Linq is a bit more difficult as Scott Hanselman discusses here . We are flirting with the idea of using has_codeblock on the base database context so that all our LINQ queries have this set. Without that, we'd have to wrap every LINQ call we make (well, the simple reading ones, which is the vast majority of them) in a  has_numeric  has_numeric  line transaction code block, which is ugly. I guess I'm a little frustrated that trivial reads in SQL  has_numeric  can deadlock on writes. I could see write/write deadlocks being a huge issue, but reads? We're not running a banking site here, we don't need perfect accuracy every time. Ideas? Thoughts? Are you instantiating a new LINQ to SQL DataContext object for every operation or are you perhaps sharing the same static context for all your calls?

Even still, there are times I need to pick up a language relatively quickly for a new project I am working on. The point of this post is to document some of the best tutorials and books for these languages. I will start the list with the best I can find, but hope you guys out there can help with better suggestions/new languages. Here is what I found: Since this is now wiki editable, I am giving control up to the community. If you have a suggestion, please put it in this section. I decided to also add a section for general be a better programmer books and online references as well. Once again, all recommendations are welcome. General Programming Online Tutorials Foundations of Programming By Karl Seguin - From Codebetter, its C# based but the ideas ring true across the board, can't believe no-one's posted this yet actually. How to Write Unmaintainable Code - An anti manual that teaches you how to write code in the most unmaintable way possible. It would be funny if a lot of these suggestions didn't ring so true. The Programming Section of Wiki Books - suggested by Jim Robert as having a large amount of books/tutorials on multiple languages in various stages of completion Just the Basics To get a feel for a language. Books Code Complete - This book goes without saying, it is truely brilliant in too many ways to mention. The Pragmatic Programmer - The next best thing to working with a master coder, teaching you everything they know. Mastering Regular Expressions - Regular Expressions are an essential tool in every programmer's toolbox. This book, recommended by Patrick Lozzi is a great way to learn what they are capable of. Algorithms in C , C++ , and Java - A great way to learn all the classic algorithms if you find Knuth's books a bit too in depth. C Online Tutorials This tutorial seems to pretty consise and thourough, looked over the material and seems to be pretty good. Not sure how friendly it would be to new programmers though. Books K&R; C - a classic for sure. It might be argued that all programmers should read it. C Primer Plus - Suggested by Imran as being the ultimate C book for beginning programmers. C: A Reference Manual - A great reference recommended by Patrick Lozzi. C++ Online Tutorials The tutorial on cplusplus.com seems to be the most complete. I found another tutorial here but it doesn't include topics like polymorphism, which I believe is essential. If you are coming from C, this tutorial might be the best for you. Another useful tutorial, C++ Annotation . In Ubuntu family you can get the ebook on multiple format(pdf, txt, Postscript, and LaTex) by installing has_codeblock package from Synaptic(installed package can be found in has_codeblock . Books The C++ Programming Language - crucial for any C++ programmer. C++ Primer Plus - Orginally added as a typo, but the amazon reviews are so good, I am going to keep it here until someone says it is a dud. Effective C++ - Ways to improve your C++ programs. More Effective C++ - Continuation of Effective C++. Effective STL - Ways to improve your use of the STL. Thinking in C++ - Great book, both volumes. Written by Bruce Eckel and Chuck Ellison. Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ - Stroustrup's introduction to C++. Accelerated C++ - Andy Koenig and Barbara Moo - An excellent introduction to C++ that doesn't treat C++ as ""C with extra bits bolted on"", in fact you dive straight in and start using STL early on. Forth Books FORTH, a text and reference. Mahlon G. Kelly and Nicholas Spies. ISBN  has_numeric  has_numeric  has_numeric  has_numeric  / ISBN  has_numeric  has_numeric  has_numeric  has_numeric .  has_numeric  Prentice-Hall. Leo Brodie's books are good but this book is even better. For instance it covers defining words and the interpreter in depth. Java Online Tutorials Sun's Java Tutorials - An official tutorial that seems thourough, but I am not a java expert. You guys know of any better ones? Books Head First Java - Recommended as a great introductory text by Patrick Lozzi. Effective Java - Recommended by pek as a great intermediate text. Core Java Volume  has_numeric  and Core Java Volume  has_numeric  - Suggested by FreeMemory as some of the best java references available. Java Concurrency in Practice - Recommended by MDC as great resource for concurrent programming in Java. The Java Programing Language Python Online Tutorials Python.org - The online documentation for this language is pretty good. If you know of any better let me know. Dive Into Python - Suggested by Nickola. Seems to be a python book online. Perl Online Tutorials perldoc perl - This is how I personally got started with the language, and I don't think you will be able to beat it. Books Learning Perl - a great way to introduce yourself to the language. Programming Perl - greatly referred to as the Perl Bible. Essential reference for any serious perl programmer. Perl Cookbook - A great book that has solutions to many common problems. Modern Perl Programming - newly released, contains the latest wisdom on modern techniques and tools, including Moose and DBIx::Class. Ruby Online Tutorials Adam Mika suggested Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby but after taking a look at it, I don't know if it is for everyone. Found this site which seems to offer several tutorials for Ruby on Rails. Books Programming Ruby - suggested as a great reference for all things ruby. Visual Basic Online Tutorials Found this site which seems to devote itself to visual basic tutorials. Not sure how good they are though. PHP Online Tutorials The main PHP site - A simple tutorial that allows user comments for each page, which I really like. PHPFreaks Tutorials - Various tutorials of different difficulty lengths. Quakenet/PHP tutorials - PHP tutorial that will guide you from ground up. JavaScript Online Tutorials Found a decent tutorial here geared toward non-programmers. Found another more advanced one here . Nickolay suggested A reintroduction to javascript as a good read here. Books Head first JavaScript JavaScript: The Good Parts (with a Google Tech Talk video by the author) C# Online Tutorials C# Station Tutorial - Seems to be a decent tutorial that I dug up, but I am not a C# guy. C# Language Specification - Suggested by tamberg. Not really a tutorial, but a great reference on all the elements of C# Books C# to the point - suggested by tamberg as a short text that explains the language in amazing depth ocaml Books nlucaroni suggested the following: OCaml for Scientists Introduction to ocaml Using Understand and unraveling ocaml: practice to theory and vice versa Developing Applications using Ocaml - O'Reilly The Objective Caml System - Official Manua Haskell Online Tutorials nlucaroni suggested the following: Explore functional programming with Haskell Books Real World Haskell Total Functional Programming LISP/Scheme Books wfarr suggested the following: The Little Schemer - Introduction to Scheme and functional programming in general The Seasoned Schemer - Followup to Little Schemer.

In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does exactly what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"". It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible in the right way , and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile. In many regards, this doesn't surprise me. The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair). Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles). So what am I missing here? Where's the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better?",What's the point of OOP?,46,12,25061.0,2131.0,2008-08-23 14:40:28,,1,1753

1350,24675,220,15478,"Before you answer this I have never developed anything popular enough to attain high server loads. Treat me as (sigh) an alien that has just landed on the planet, albeit one that knows PHP and a few optimisation techniques. I'm developing a tool in PHP that could attain quite a lot of users, if it works out right. However while I'm fully capable of developing the program I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to making something that can deal with huge traffic. So here's a few questions on it (feel free to turn this question into a resource thread as well). Databases At the moment I plan to use the MySQLi features in PHP5. However how should I setup the databases in relation to users and content? Do I actually need multiple databases? At the moment everything's jumbled into one database - although I've been considering spreading user data to one, actual content to another and finally core site content (template masters etc.) to another. My reasoning behind this is that sending queries to different databases will ease up the load on them as one database =  has_numeric  load sources. Also would this still be effective if they were all on the same server? Caching I have a template system that is used to build the pages and swap out variables. Master templates are stored in the database and each time a template is called it's cached copy (a html document) is called. At the moment I have two types of variable in these templates - a static var and a dynamic var. Static vars are usually things like page names, the name of the site - things that don't change often; dynamic vars are things that change on each page load. My question on this: Say I have comments on different articles. Which is a better solution: store the simple comment template and render comments (from a DB call) each time the page is loaded or store a cached copy of the comments page as a html page - each time a comment is added/edited/deleted the page is recached. Finally Does anyone have any tips/pointers for running a high load site on PHP. I'm pretty sure it's a workable language to use - Facebook and Yahoo! give it great precedence - but are there any experiences I should watch out for?",Tactics for using PHP in a high-load site,23,4,24689.0,2025.0,2008-08-23 22:37:49,,1,2188

Or should I look at different JavaScript libraries? I know Jeff uses jQuery on Stack Overflow and it seems to be working well. Thanks! Edit : jQuery's website has a pretty big list of tutorials , and a seemingly comprehensive documentation page . I haven't had time to go through it all yet, has anyone else had experience with it? Edit  has_numeric  : It seems Google is now hosting the jQuery libraries. That should give jQuery a pretty big advantage in terms of publicity. Also, if everyone uses a single unified aQuery library hosted at the same place, it should get cached for most Internet users early on and therefore not impact the download footprint of your site should you decide to use it.  has_numeric  Months Later... Edit  has_numeric  : I started using jQuery on a project at work recently and it is great to work with! Just wanted to let everyone know that I have concluded it is ABSOLUTELY worth it to learn and use jQuery. Also, I learned almost entirely from the Official jQuery documentation and tutorials . It's very straightforward.  has_numeric  Months Later... jQuery is a part of just about every web app I've made since I initially wrote this post. It makes progressive enhancement a breeze, and helps make the code maintainable. Also, all the jQuery plug-ins are an invaluable resource!  has_numeric  Years Later...

So right now "" has_numeric  has_numeric * has_numeric "" returns  has_numeric , not  has_numeric  as one might expect. While this is suitable for the current project, I want to have a general purpose routine I can use for later projects. Edited for clarity: What is a good algorithm for parsing equations with precedence? I'm interested in something simple to implement and understand that I can code myself to avoid licensing issues with available code. Grammar: I don't understand the grammar question - I've written this by hand. It's simple enough that I don't see the need for YACC or Bison. I merely need to calculate strings with equations such as "" has_numeric  has_numeric  * ( has_numeric / has_numeric )"". Language: I'm doing this in C, but I'm interested in an algorithm, not a language specific solution. C is low level enough that it'll be easy to convert to another language should the need arise. Code Example I posted the test code for the simple expression parser I was talking about above. The project requirements altered and so I never needed to optimize the code for performance or space as it wasn't incorporated into the project. It's in the original verbose form, and should be readily understandable. If I do anything further with it in terms of operator precedence, I'll probably choose the macro hack because it matches the rest of the program in simplicity.

1516,35991,58,24613,"I'm considering using Django for a project I'm starting (fyi, a browser-based game) and one of the features I'm liking the most is using has_codeblock to automatically create the database tables based on the Django models I define (a feature that I can't seem to find in any other framework). I was already thinking this was too good to be true when I saw this in the documentation : Syncdb will not alter existing tables syncdb will only create tables for models which have not yet been installed. It will never issue ALTER TABLE statements to match changes made to a model class after installation. Changes to model classes and database schemas often involve some form of ambiguity and, in those cases, Django would have to guess at the correct changes to make. There is a risk that critical data would be lost in the process. If you have made changes to a model and wish to alter the database tables to match, use the sql command to display the new SQL structure and compare that to your existing table schema to work out the changes. It seems that altering existing tables will have to be done ""by hand"". What I would like to know is the best way to do this. Two solutions come to mind: As the documentation suggests, make the changes manually in the DB; Do a backup of the database, wipe it, create the tables again (with syncdb, since now it's creating the tables from scratch) and import the backed-up data (this might take too long if the database is big) Any ideas?",Altering database tables in Django,8,0,186996.0,2841.0,2008-08-30 14:36:39,,1,1474

In this group, we mostly used LabVIEW to write programs for controlling our setups, doing data acquisition and analyzing our data. For the first two purposes, that works quite OK, but for data analysis, it's a real pain. On top of that, everyone was mostly self-taught, so code that was written was generally quite a mess (no wonder that every PhD quickly decided to rewrite everything from scratch). Version control was unknown, and impossible to set up because of strict software and network regulations from the IT department. Now, things actually worked out surprisingly OK, but how do people in the natural sciences do their software development? Questions Some concrete questions: What languages/environments have you used for developing scientific software, especially data analysis? What libraries? (for example, what do you use for plotting?) Was there any training for people without any significant background in programming? Did you have anything like version control, and bug tracking? How would you go about trying to create a decent environment for programming, without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists (especially physicists are stubborn people!)

The Software Carpentry course is a good way to teach programming and development techniques to scientists. How to improve things? Don't force people to follow strict protocols.

I'm looking for something that is flexible enough to handle international numbers, and also something that allows the various parts of the number to be queried efficiently. Edit: Just to clarify the use case here: I currently store numbers in a single varchar field, and I leave them just as the customer entered them. Then, when the number is needed by code, I normalize it. The problem is that if I want to query a few million rows to find matching phone numbers, it involves a function, like has_codeblock which is terribly inefficient. Also queries that are looking for things like the area code become extremely tricky when it's just a single varchar field. [Edit] People have made lots of good suggestions here, thanks! As an update, here is what I'm doing now: I still store numbers exactly as they were entered, in a varchar field, but instead of normalizing things at query time, I have a trigger that does all that work as records are inserted or updated.

1640,43995,87,10836,Handling multiple merges onto branches in Subversion or CVS is just one of those things that has to be experienced. It is inordinately easier to keep track of branches and merges in Mercurial (and probably any other distributed system) but I don't know why. Does anyone else know? My question stems from the fact that with Mercurial you can adopt a working practice similar to that of Subversions/CVSs central repository and everything will work just fine. You can do multiple merges on the same branch and you won't need endless scraps of paper with commit numbers and tag names. I know the latest version of Subversion has the ability to track merges to branches so you don't get quite the same degree of hassle but it was a huge and major development on their side and it still doesn't do everything the development team would like it to do.

1688,46586,207,41795,"Everyone is aware of Dijkstra's Letters to the editor: go to statement considered harmful (also here .html transcript and here .pdf) and there has been a formidable push since that time to eschew the goto statement whenever possible. While it's possible to use goto to produce unmaintainable, sprawling code, it nevertheless remains in modern programming languages . Even the advanced continuation control structure in Scheme can be described as a sophisticated goto. What circumstances warrant the use of goto? When is it best to avoid? As a followup question: C provides a pair of functions, setjmp and longjmp, that provide the ability to goto not just within the current stack frame but within any of the calling frames. Should these be considered as dangerous as goto? More dangerous? Dijkstra himself regretted that title, for which he was not responsible. At the end of EWD1308 (also here .pdf) he wrote: Finally a short story for the record. In  has_numeric , the Communications of the ACM published a text of mine under the title "" The goto statement considered harmful "", which in later years would be most frequently referenced, regrettably, however, often by authors who had seen no more of it than its title, which became a cornerstone of my fame by becoming a template: we would see all sorts of articles under the title ""X considered harmful"" for almost any X, including one titled ""Dijkstra considered harmful"". But what had happened? I had submitted a paper under the title "" A case against the goto statement "", which, in order to speed up its publication, the editor had changed into a ""letter to the Editor"", and in the process he had given it a new title of his own invention! The editor was Niklaus Wirth. A well thought out classic paper about this topic, to be matched to that of Dijkstra, is Structured Programming with go to Statements , by Donald E. Knuth. Reading both helps to reestablish context and a non-dogmatic understanding of the subject. In this paper, Dijkstra's opinion on this case is reported and is even more strong: Donald E. Knuth: I believe that by presenting such a view I am not in fact disagreeing sharply with Dijkstra's ideas, since he recently wrote the following: ""Please don't fall into the trap of believing that I am terribly dogmatical about [the go to statement]. I have the uncomfortable feeling that others are making a religion out of it, as if the conceptual problems of programming could be solved by a single trick, by a simple form of coding discipline!

We are also looking at having multiple solutions to achieve greater separation of concerns and quicker compile times for each element of the application. This I can see will become a DLL hell as we try to keep things in synch. I am interested to know how other teams have dealt with this scaling issue, what do you do when your code base reaches a critical mass that you are wasting half the day watching the status bar deliver compile messages. UPDATE I neglected to mention this is a C# solution. Thanks for all the C++ suggestions, but it's been a few years since I've had to worry about headers. EDIT: Nice suggestions that have helped so far (not saying there aren't other nice suggestions below, just what has helped) New 3GHz laptop - the power of lost utilization works wonders when whinging to management Disable Anti Virus during compile 'Disconnecting' from VSS (actually the network) during compile - I may get us to remove VS-VSS integration altogether and stick to using the VSS UI Still not rip-snorting through a compile, but every bit helps. Orion did mention in a comment that generics may have a play also. From my tests there does appear to be a minimal performance hit, but not high enough to sure - compile times can be inconsistent due to disc activity. Due to time limitations, my tests didn't include as many Generics, or as much code, as would appear in live system, so that may accumulate. I wouldn't avoid using generics where they are supposed to be used, just for compile time performance WORKAROUND We are testing the practice of building new areas of the application in new solutions, importing in the latest dlls as required, them integrating them into the larger solution when we are happy with them. We may also do them same to existing code by creating temporary solutions that just encapsulate the areas we need to work on, and throwing them away after reintegrating the code. We need to weigh up the time it will take to reintegrate this code against the time we gain by not having Rip Van Winkle like experiences with rapid recompiling during development.",Very slow compile times on Visual Studio 2005,34,4,55645.0,5302.0,2008-09-10 23:56:00,,1,2525

Pointers can point nowhere ( has_codeblock ), whereas reference always refer to an object. You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers.

To clarify a misconception: The C++ standard is very careful to avoid dictating how a compiler must implement references, but every C++ compiler implements references as pointers. That is, a declaration such as: has_codeblock if it's not optimized away entirely , allocates the same amount of storage as a pointer, and places the address of i into that storage. So, a pointer and a reference both occupy the same amount of memory. As a general rule, Use references in function parameters and return types to define useful and self-documenting interfaces.

1911,61401,175,45392,"I know this sounds like a point-whoring question but let me explain where I'm coming from. Out of college I got a job at a PHP shop. I worked there for a year and a half and thought that I had learned all there was to learn about programming. Then I got a job as a one-man internal development shop at a sizable corporation where all the work was in C#. In my commitment to the position I started reading a ton of blogs and books and quickly realized how wrong I was to think I knew everything. I learned about unit testing, dependency injection and decorator patterns, the design principle of loose coupling, the composition over inheritance debate, and so on and on and on - I am still very much absorbing it all. Needless to say my programming style has changed entirely in the last year. Now I find myself picking up a php project doing some coding for a friend's start-up and I feel completely constrained as opposed to programming in C#. It really bothers me that all variables at a class scope have to be referred to by appending '$this->' . It annoys me that none of the IDEs that I've tried have very good intellisense and that my SimpleTest unit tests methods have to start with the word 'test'. It drives me crazy that dynamic typing keeps me from specifying implicitly which parameter type a method expects, and that you have to write a switch statement to do method overloads. I can't stand that you can't have nested namespaces and have to use the :: operator to call the base class's constructor. Now I have no intention of starting a PHP vs C# debate, rather what I mean to say is that I'm sure there are some PHP features that I either don't know about or know about yet fail to use properly.

In discussions about what technologies we will use we have settled on running a JBoss application server, and Flex frontend (with possible desktop deployment using Adobe AIR), and web services to interface the client and server.
