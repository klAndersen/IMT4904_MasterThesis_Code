 I have a website that I am making and I was going to implement a perl script into it. This script goes to another page gets a .csv file and reads in the lines and parses out what I need. The problem I have just ran into is that my hosting server apparently does not allow custom CGI scripts on an MS server. I chose the MS server so I could use ASP and apparently lost other functionality when doing so. Is there another language that I can use to get the same effect as my perl script?

 I had a prototype of my website working correctly, meaning it connected to the database correctly.

 I'm scraping a site, searching for JPGs to download.
 
  Scraping the site's HTML pages works fine.
  
   But when I try getting the JPGs with
   
    CURL, copy(), fopen()
   
   , etc., I get a
   
    403 forbiden
   
   status.
  
  
   I know that's because the site owners don't want their images scraped, so I understand a good answer would be
   
    just don't do it, because they don't want you to
   
   .
  
  
   Ok, but let's say it's ok and I try to work around this, how could this be achieved?
  
  
   If I get the same URL with a browser, I can open the image perfectly, it's not that my IP is banned or anything, and I'm testing the scraper one file at a time, so it's not blocking me because I make too many requests too often.
  
  
   From my understanding, it could be that either the site is checking for some cookies that confirm that I'm using a browser and browsing their site before I download a JPG.
   
    Or that maybe PHP is using some user agent for the requests that the server can detect and filter out.
   
   
    Anyway, have any idea?

  Right now I'm tossing up between this:
 
 
  has_code
 
 
  and this:
 
 
  has_code
 
 
  My guess is that the second option is faster, since it'll come back with a result as soon as it sees the first item, whereas the second option (for an IEnumerable) will need to visit every item to return the count.
 
 
  That being said, does the second option look as readable to you? Which would you prefer? Or can you think of a better way to test for an empty list?

 It seems that everybody is jumping on the dynamic, non-compiled bandwagon lately.  I've mostly only worked in compiled, static typed languages (C, Java, .Net).  The experience I have with dynamic languages is stuff like ASP (Vb Script), JavaScript, and PHP.  Using these technologies has left a bad taste in my mouth when thinking about dynamic languages.  Things that usually would have been caught by the compiler such as misspelled variable names and assigning an value of the wrong type to a variable don't occur until runtime.  And even then, you may not notice an error, as it just creates a new variable, and assigns some default value.  I've also never seen intellisense work well in a dynamic language, since, well, variables don't have any explicit type.

    Any way to delete in vim without overwriting your last yank?
   
  
 
 
  Using vim I often want to replace a block of code with a block that I just yanked.
But when I delete the block of code that is to be replaced, that block itself goes into the register which erases the block I just yanked. So I've got in the habit of yanking, then inserting, then deleting what I didn't want, but with large blocks of code this gets messy trying to keep the inserted block and the block to delete separate.
 
 
  So what is the slickest and quickest way to replace text in vim?
 
 
  
   is there a way to delete text without putting it into the register?
