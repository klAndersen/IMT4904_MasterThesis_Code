4,416914,-6,3129,"this post is not really a question, but it could be useful to share some coding tips. here is the one i'd like to share with you. i'm going to show  has_numeric  examples that do the same thing. but only the last one will be the best. has_codeblock i'm sure you all know that has_codeblock won't work, but still, i'm pretty sure that you use double quote to display a simple information. this is bad . well let's begin : the first one is bad (as well as the second) because using double quote forces  has_attached_tag  to scan the string to look for a substitution to be done (i mean a variable). the second one is a little better, since  has_attached_tag  has no replacement to do. the third one, is better because of simple quote, so that the language knows he can just send the text without processing, but the ""bad"" thing is the use of concatenation (dot operator, like in the second example). the last one uses simple quote, and the coma operator. why is this solution better? well, what happens when using the third solution?  has_attached_tag  creates a string, containing has_codeblock , then it has to enlarge it, to put the content of foo variable (""john smith""), and then, enlarge it again to put has_codeblock sentence. then, has_codeblock can use this, to ... echo it :) whereas in the 4th one, the only thing to do for has_codeblock is to send ""hello "", then $foo's content, then "" welcome on my website."" to the output, and that is all! because echo just has to send the text, without creating a string that will have to be enlarged to contain the whole text (that would have been concave, which has to be grown (because of concatenation) and then displayed. i'll try to find back some benchmarks and put them here. fell free to comment or react, and excuse my english, this is not my mother tongue.",Optimizing PHP string concatenation,5,8,,51760.0,2009-01-06 15:16:05,<php><optimization>,2012-12-10 07:54:04,-1,1814

91,972,324,89396,"i've read that it is possible to add a method to an existing object (e.g. not in the class definition) in  has_attached_tag  , i think this is called monkey patching (or in some cases duck punching ). i understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. but, how might one do this? update  has_numeric / has_numeric / has_numeric   has_numeric : has_numeric : has_numeric  est: has_links looks like a good answer john downey, i tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a true method. your example defines the new patch function with an argument of has_codeblock , but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named has_codeblock (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call has_codeblock instead of just has_codeblock if you want the same functionality as a true method. it looks like  has_attached_tag  isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function (and as such is callable). is there any way to attach an actual method to a class? oh, and ryan, has_links isn't exactly what i was looking for (it isn't a builtin functionality), but it is quite cool nonetheless.",Adding a Method to an Existing Object Instance,16,3,2982.0,145.0,2008-08-04 02:17:51,<python><oop><methods><monkeypatching>,,1,1308
