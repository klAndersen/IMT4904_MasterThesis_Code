0,48295,-14,1096,"<p>First, what is the proper terminology for a ""string"" in TeX/LaTeX that is an argument for a macro? e.g., <code>\macro{somestring}</code> Obviously <code>somestring</code> is a token, set of tokens, string, argument, etc. I will call it a string since I do not know what else to call it. I'm not thinking it is another macro but sort of ""inert"" text.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I want to be able to do is parse a string that represents macros in LaTeX but codified in a very simple way:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The best way to describe it is to give an example</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The follow string </p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>x4y3[cgreen, t4[-3,4,a90]]&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>represents setting properties</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>x-position = 4<br>&#xA;  y-position = 3<br>&#xA;  color = green  </p>&#xA;  &#xA;  <p>test = 4 with x offset -3, y offset 4 and angle 90<br>&#xA;  <code>[ ]</code> = optional (optional list of optional specifiers in no particular order)</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>It should be <strong>VERY</strong> self explanatory how I went from the condensed string to the properties it represents. If not stare at the string for a few hours. You should be able to read the string and tell exactly what it means after knowing what the indicator symbols are. (this is no different than what xparse does with it's specification string except mine is a little more complex)</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now the hard part, I want to be able to parse that string into a series of macros that set data. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As you can probably guess it, the string represents something to do with placing a graphic at a location.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If you want to have some interpretation for</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>x4y3[cgreen, t4[-3,4,a90]]&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>to make you feel better: Place a green circle at coordinates(4,3) with a piece of text ""4"" offset (-3,4) from it and rotated 90 degrees.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To do this cleanly and efficiently I would like to create macros that are called for each corresponding macro in the string</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>\def\x#1{}&#xA;\def\y#1{}&#xA;\def\c#1{}&#xA;\def\t#1#2{}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So we could see the string as simply calling <code>\x{-3}\y{4}\c{green}\t{4}{-3,4,a90}</code></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So as you can see the string is just a ""condensed"" version of a macro. The string simply is a command value pair with possible optional arguments.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One could almost simply go in and add <code>\'</code>s and brackets to get the command.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>pseudo-code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>parse_string{&#xA;    foreach token in command-list&#xA;        write '\'token'{'next_token'}'    &#xA;}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But I would like to add commands/macros that have more than one character (the smallest token size would take precedence) AND do other things like default values.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Anyways, as usual this is relatively straightforward in most procedural programming languages but I'm sure I'll spend the next few weeks trying to figure out how to do it in TeX/LaTeX and then 10k lines of code later I'll probably end up with a buggy as hell version.</p>&#xA;",Stringified commands to macros sequence,2,12,48320.0,11637.0,2012-03-16 20:29:53,<macros><parsing><xparse>,2014-06-21 23:52:42,-1,3203

For example, if I want to call a command with two arguments and the arguments expand before the command, here's how I've coded it:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>\expandafter&#xA;  \expandafter&#xA;  \expandafter&#xA;  \command\expandafter&#xA;            \expandafter&#xA;            \expandafter&#xA;              {\expandafter&#xA;                \argone&#xA;                \expandafter&#xA;              }\expandafter&#xA;              {\argtwo}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I'm looking for guidance on when and how to control expansion in defining macros.

228,35039,57,1284,"<p>TeX's macro processor does its work in a process called <em>expansion</em>. For an input stream of tokens, the macro processor repeatedly <em>expands</em> them until non-expandable tokens remain. The resulting stream of non-expandable tokens is passed to the TeX's execution processor. The process of expansion can be viewed as calling a function that expands to its result.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Macros absorb their arguments from the input stream and expand to their replacement text, with arguments in-place. Other types of tokens can be expanded differently: for example, conditionals test their arguments (possibly expanding them, too) and skip the branch for which the condition is false.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But there are also non-trivial tokens that are <em>not</em> expandable: most notably, <code>\def</code> and (not actually a token, but see below) register assignments. This means that they can't be used in a macro to obtain a result through expansion: they will be just passed through untouched.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>\edef\test{\def\a{x}\a}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>will fail with <code>! Undefined control sequence.</code>, because <code>\def</code> was not expanded and then <code>\a</code> was examined, which proved to be undefined.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Likewise,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>\newcount\count&#xA;\edef\test{\count=1}&#xA;\showthe\count&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>will show <code>0</code>, not <code>1</code>, because, again, none of <code>\count=1</code> were expandable.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One can imagine a system where such operations <em>are</em> expandable. More precisely, expanding <code>\def</code> would absorb a control sequence name, parameter text and replacement text from the input stream, define the new macro and expand to nothing. Similarly, an operation named <code>\assign</code> would read a register name and a value from the input, do the assignment and expand to nothing. This can be also extended to <code>\let</code>, <code>\advance</code> etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thus the above examples would now behave differently: in the first <code>\edef</code>, <code>\def</code> would read in <code>\a{x}</code>, define <code>\a</code> and expand to empty text. After this expansion the token list would contain <code>\a</code>, which would then expand to <code>x</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the second example (let it be</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>\edef\test{\assign\count1}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>now) <code>\assign</code> would set <code>\count</code> to <code>1</code>, and expand to nothing. In the result <code>\test</code> would be defined to be empty, but the value of <code>\count</code> would have been altered.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This new system would allow to achieve some things in a more straightward manner. For example, the problem of defining a macro expanding to <em>n</em> asterisks could now be solved with</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>\newcount\c&#xA;\def\asterisks#1{%&#xA;  \assign\c0&#xA;  \loop\ifnum\c&lt;#1&#xA;    *%&#xA;    \advance\c by 1&#xA;  \repeat}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>, because (see the definitions of <code>\loop</code> and <code>\iterate</code>) <code>\def</code>, <code>\let</code> and assignments are now expandable. Another substantial consequence would be that many more things could be done in macros whose result is passed as an argument to another macro. Observe how e-TeX's <code>\numexpr</code> and friends are already a considerable step in this direction.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The question is: Why doesn't TeX implement such an approach, leaving instead some important operations non-expandable? What are the shortcomings of this approach and the advantages of TeX's implementation?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One possible reason might be that Knuth wanted macros to act as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function"">pure functions</a>, incapable of changing the context they are being expanded in. A similar hint can be found in the <em>TeXbook</em> on the matter:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>The expansion of expandable tokens takes place in TeX's ""mouth,"" but&#xA;  primitive commands (including assignments) are done in TeX's&#xA;  ""stomach."" One important consequence of this structure is that it is&#xA;  impossible to redefine a control sequence or to advance a register&#xA;  while TeX is expanding the token list of, say, a <code>\message</code> or&#xA;  <code>\write</code> command; assignment operations are done only when TeX is&#xA;  building a vertical or horizontal or math list.</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Another reason might be that nested and/or recursive macro calls could interfere with each other if they had write access to ""external"" data available to them.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Note: the question is not about what is permitted and what is not by the architecture of TeX, but about why such architecture was designed in the first place.</em></p>&#xA;",Why isn't everything expandable?,3,3,35188.0,3104.0,2011-11-16 11:17:56,<macros><tex-core><expansion>,,1,4904

Do you fall back to a Word processing program, or do you stick with TeX, even though it might implicate a bit more hassle to get your final document? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In other words, do you find TeX can replace any type of document creation in everyday use, or is it overkill for simple documents? </p>&#xA;","As an expert, can you always use TeX for (nearly) any kind of document?",20,11,41925.0,11045.0,2012-01-22 20:53:27,<msword><open-office>,,1,824

Most people talk about 'converting' from one TeX to another, but given the fact that I am a beginner I am looking for the proper TeX flavor right now, so that I do not need to change preambles and such when I am learning about new things that are only available when using other TeX engines. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Some details about my usage:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>I visualize using TeX mostly for business reports, memos, and investigations. </li>&#xA;<li>I also might use it for presentations and publishing in book-format. </li>&#xA;<li>I will not be using advanced math nor Chinese or other very non-Latin symbols.</li>&#xA;<li>Being a beginner, I do not need to convert any old documents. I have been reading about <a href=""http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html"">LaTeX3</a>, however, and this <em>seems</em> like a version that will be superior to the existing TeX options. So when this becomes available, I envision switching to this. So if that is of any validity, I'd say that easy conversion to / compatibility with LaTex3 would be important. </li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, I read about an issue with 'microtype' in XeTeX, but I do not really get what that is and if this would affect me. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To quote from <a href=""http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/22823/which-tex-should-one-use"">this question</a> related to another beginner's question:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>XeLaTeX would be (especially) suitable to you, for better (Unicode)&#xA;  multilingual support and easy font switching.

These are ""algorithmic"" tools, while the direction of LuaTeX development appears to be ""data structure"" tools.  Of course, Lua is also a general-purpose programming language and as such provides perfectly good algorithmic tools as well.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>Why use LaTeX3 programming over Lua, when LuaTex is available?</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I understand that LuaTeX is very much experimental now, but then, so is LaTeX3.  I also understand that as a result, LuaTeX is not necessarily used by anyone ""ordinary"", but then, it is intended as the ultimate successor to pdfTeX, which is now the default engine in the major TeX distributions.  For all the reasons that TeX is a terrible programming language, LaTeX3 will still suffer from irritating expansion issues, lack of arithmetic capabilities, poor (or at least poor man's) variables, and so on.  However, Knuth himself <a href=""http://www.pytex.org/#macros"">has written</a> that he would have used a better language if one had been available.  Now that ""we"" are inserting Lua into the TeX executable it appears that this alternative has been identified (ironically, that link is about PyTeX, based on Python).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now that <code>\directlua</code> is feasible, I don't see why it is not better in every way simply to make all ""function"" macros (those that do not directly store text) hook into that one primitive and then do all their programming in Lua.  Loops, variables, recursion, and so on can all be done in a comprehensible way.  A lot of effort in the development of LaTeX3 appears to be in managing the programming language and its use.  So, I ask again:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>Why use LaTeX3 to program at all?  Why not turn its development into the development of a LaTeX-style document design library for LuaTeX, written in Lua?</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This suggests a related question to me:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<blockquote>&#xA;  <p>Is the separation of LuaTeX and LaTeX3 a result (or at least an artifact) of the non-communication among developers that Ahmed Musa described in his comment to <a href=""http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/43661/575"">this answer</a>?  What kind of cooperation is there between these two projects to reduce duplication of effort?</p>&#xA;</blockquote>&#xA;&#xA;<p>(An even more fantastical notion is to implement <em>every</em> primitive, except <code>\directlua</code> itself, in terms of Lua and various internal typesetting parameters, thus completely divorcing the programming side of TeX from the typesetting side.  Then TeX itself would be a ""macro package"" on top of LuaTeX and one would not be bound to its strange design choices.  An answer to why that should or should not be done might be too long for me to request, however.)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I don't personally think that this is too bloggy for this site, and I hope others agree.  At least, given the confluence of expertise here, it seems to be the best place to ask the question.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have accepted Frank Mittelbach's answer, though all the answers are extremely informative, because I think it hits all the main points most directly.  One thing that neither it nor Joseph Wright's answer quite manages to come out and say directly is that ConTeXt <em>does</em> do the Lua-programming thing at least to some extent, and it does not solve all algorithmic problems because LuaTeX does not actually rewrite the underpinnings of TeX so much as stitch in a Lua layer that can interact with them.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I guess the one-line answer to my question is that my expectations of LuaTeX are much more grand than its reality, much like my ""fantastical"" idea.</p>&#xA;",LaTeX3 versus pure Lua,5,8,45226.0,575.0,2012-02-20 19:18:48,<luatex><programming><latex3><expl3>,,1,5008

It depends on the <code>l3graph</code> package I'm working on, which is not ready for CTAN yet.

For the average user, everything would <em>just work</em>. The user interface looks like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>\documentclass{article}&#xA;&#xA;\usepackage{pkgloader}&#xA;&#xA;% List packages in any order you please&#xA;\usepackage{xltxtra}&#xA;\usepackage[xetex]{graphicx}&#xA;&#xA;\LoadPackagesNow&#xA;&#xA;\begin{document}&#xA;\end{document}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>By redefining <code>\usepackage</code> (and friends), <code>pkgloader</code> gathers the list of packages (with options) that the user wants to load, then loads them in the right order at the <code>\LoadPackagesNow</code> command. The package order above (needs XeTeX) would immediately cause an error if not for <code>pkgloader</code>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It is able to prevent the problem because I've already included a modest list of package-ordering rules:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>\Load {fancyhdr} before {hyperref}&#xA;\Load {fncychap} before {hyperref}&#xA;\Load {float}    before {hyperref}&#xA;\Load {hyperref} before {algorithm}&#xA;\Load {amssymb}  before {xunicode}&#xA;\Load {amssymb}  before {xltxtra}&#xA;\Load {graphicx} before {xltxtra}&#xA;\Load {graphicx} before {fontspec}&#xA;\Load {caption}  before {subfig}&#xA;</code></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>These can also be added manually.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Potential Features</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Fixing the package loading order is only the first (and simplest) step. With a bit of extra work we could add features like the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>A package ordering rule like: <code>\Load {cleveref} late</code> (or <code>early</code>)</li>&#xA;<li>Facilities for package authors to include their own resolutions in a uniform way</li>&#xA;<li>Automatic detection of cycles within the rules</li>&#xA;<li>Accumulating and combining package options, with specific rules per package</li>&#xA;<li>Adding extra 'glue code' to make two other packages behave (if they're both being loaded)</li>&#xA;<li>Automatically resolving pretty much every conflict listed on <a href=""http://www.macfreek.nl/memory/LaTeX_package_conflicts#Caption_and_Subfig"">Freek's page</a>.</li>&#xA;<li>For conflicts that cannot (yet) be resolved, at least show an error message rather than let things go wrong at a later stage.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Question: What prior work is there?</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Specifically:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Is there already another package that does (something like) this?</li>&#xA;<li>Are there any specific pitfalls I should be aware of?</li>&#xA;<li>Other than <a href=""http://www.macfreek.nl/memory/LaTeX_package_conflicts#Caption_and_Subfig"">Freek's page</a>, is there any kind of comprehensive list of known conflicts and resolutions?</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I think a package like this has the potential to be very useful to a lot of people, if I do this right.
